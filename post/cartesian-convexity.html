            Another form of cartesian hole is a 'leak', e.g. "I can't see why teaching a computer lots of heuristics wouldn't compound infinitely!", causing you to stem the flow of energy upstream until you correct it. Reminds me of <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#comment-4949">what mummies do on purpose</a>.

          <blockquote>
            <p>Arguably, a lot of ideas shouldn’t be argued. Anyone who wants to know them, will. Anyone who needs an argument has chosen not to believe them. I think “don’t have kids if you care about other people” falls under this.</p>

            I typically leave <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#glue-philosophy">glue philosophy</a> unspoken in my writing, as a matter of maintaining cartesian convexity. This is the polar opposite of how "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/net-negative">rationalists</a>" write. My writing can be seen as a thread of invocations of thoughts: expressions welling up from <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#prime">Prime</a> self-evident in terms of where to place them in your 'puzzle' ('self-locating'), rather than serialized <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#cut-off">cut-off</a> chunks. You can tell I'm having difficulty maintaining convexity (or you're not keeping up with me) if my writing starts to look like a series of nearly disconnected statements.

            'Paradoxes' are apparent cartesian asymmetries (and typically cartesian asymmetries are thought of as 'paradoxes'). e.g. "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">Why does anything exist at all?</a>" or free will vs determinism.

            <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism">Epiphenomenalism</a> violates cartesian convexity via outright claiming souls have a <em>specific</em> and one-way-disconnected inside and outside, rather than being atomic and contiguous.
            </p>

            <p>
              Consider how you would even pose the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a>", without violating cartesian convexity.
            </p>

            <p>
              Regarding compatibalism between "free will vs determinism", we already naively expected in the first place that choices must have the capacity to have be made for reasons. "Determinism" here is actually referring to the <a href="../post/genesis-troll-line.html">genesis troll line</a>, or imagining that the future absolutely cannot effect the past, or imagining entirely causally containing someone indefinitely and being able to totally preempt their actions (<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#canceferrence">making them a slave</a>?), which makes "free will vs determinism" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#paradox-misattribution">paradox misattribution</a>. I remember considering it like "well I guess the only alternative to being deterministic would be being random, weird that it was almost like I used to <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/ancient-wisdom-fixed/">believe in a third category</a>". Calling compatibalism a "solution" then buries that lingering confusion.
            </p>

            <p>
              Also consider the relation between "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">philosophical zombies</a>" and what it means to lack an <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#avatar">avatar</a>. And the relation between "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">solipsism</a>" and <a href="#redistribution-by-taking-credit">paradox redistribution by taking credit</a>.
