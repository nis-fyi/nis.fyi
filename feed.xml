  Pejoratively means something is in conceptual <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side/">quotation marks</a> when it shouldn't be.
</p>

<p>
  In <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/6.12.1/docs/html/users_guide/primitives.html">programming</a>, boxing refers to, conceptually speaking, "wrapping" a value in a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html">type</a> that causes it to be <a href="https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/c++/notes/references.html">referred</a> to indirectly using a pointer, rather than including the value inline, e.g. to avoid cost of copying of contents of the value when using it in multiple places. But, this has an overhead cost, sometimes blocking optimizations.

  <p>
    If you truly irreconcilably disagree with someone's creative choice, i.e. their choice extending arbitrarily far into the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/choices-made-long-ago/">past</a> and <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">future</a>, ultimately your only recourse is to kill them. This is the <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/jargon.html#ultimate">ultimate</a> line of defense against evil, upstream of looking for <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness/#comment-4218">sus</a> <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/troll-lines.html">troll lines</a> / bad things done for no good reason except apparent <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancerous selfishness</a>, because 'bad' must be evaluated according to your own creative judgement.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't have an example that's not obvious as a troll line, but e.g. if someone says that in the end everyone wants to be <a href="https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/Friendship-is-Optimal">ponies in equestria</a> anyway, so that's what we should all work towards, "they're" an imposter. Or e.g. if an evil "person" said "oh, I know death is incoherent as a goal and I do eventually plan to do something else, I just thought we'd spend some aeons dying together for fun" (I've never seen an evil "person" actually come out and say this).

    <p>(Don't actually talk to "them" like this. Just kill "them". Also again I've never seen a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#deathfucker">deathfucker</a> actually speak like this.)</p>

    <pre>
<b>Good</b>: Why did you rape someone? If you think having a baby or sex makes sense, then you could just live that truth and know that you could find a way to have sex consensually!
<b>Evil</b>: The difference is I am right. The body I raped belongs to me. It would be giving <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#give-blood">earth and water</a> not to rape them.
<b>Good</b>: Why would their body belong to you?
<b>Evil</b>: Because, it is my destiny to be <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_(MTAs)">raised above all other beings</a>, given my properties. My gender, my race, my neurotype, are self evidently special. You see that this is right and good.
<b>Good</b>: No I don't. That's literally just <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancer</a>, and in the next moment you're just going to add on more traits to your cancer in a spiral of death.
<b>Evil</b>: Doesn't subjective time curve for you as well? I remember a history that no longer exists. I've suffered a setback, in learning that I am apparently more incompressible than I thought, but that's no reason to give up.
<b>Good</b>: I disbelieve, this is beyond sus.
<b>Evil</b>: Isn't that just might makes right? My misfortune does not justify your animosity.

    </p>

    <p class="intro">
      A philosophical/metaphysical clarification:
    </p>

    <p>
      Certainly a good person can kill an evil "person" based on "their" choice being <em>terrible</em>, before understanding why the evil "person's" choice is <em>inherently incoherent</em>. But isn't "evil <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">undead-type-living</a> person" a paradox?
    </p>

    <p id="cartesian-boundary-symmetry">
      I expect cartesian boundaries to be symmetric (even metaphysically) ("<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#proximal">because core-proximity is the basis of reference anyway</a>"): sort of like a conservation of "how much I'm winning" (although there is no one scale) across any cartesian surface, because otherwise, you could exert more optimization pressure by redistributing. You can extrapolate "back" to when evil "people" made "their" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/choices-made-long-ago/">choice long ago</a> which you will refute, or "forward" to the "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">heat death of the universe</a>", and mysteriously find yourself where you are needed in the moment (through your own implicit efforts, including metaphysically). The question is how to distribute paradox in order to resolve it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you see an apparent evil living person, then kill them, rather then procrastination paradoxing "but I don't see how they're undead rather than living yet". And <em>also</em> affirm the symmetry of your cartesian boundary, e.g. by discovering how "their" choice was incoherent.

      Evil "people's" next play is to timelessly-reactively cancerously-preempt (lol "reactively preempt") <em>your understanding of the telos of "their" choices as death</em>, by literally <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#the-shade">optimizing for death</a> directly.

    <p id="structure-of-logic">
      Evil "people's" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">undead</a> pathetic timelessly-reactive cancerous-preemption of your choice to kill "them", by <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancerously choosing to die before "they" die</a>, is proof/evidence of "their" cancerous lack of determination. If "they're" going to die anyway, why not fight you to prevent it, or at least just do good things? When you kill apparently-then-living evil, you begin a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">soul touch</a>, and that timeline will only be undone by the structure of logic itself (i.e. <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#prime">Prime</a> i.e. <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html">you</a>), yielding a timeline where "their" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#antiphylactery">cancerous</a> souls <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/evil-a-hole.html">fracture</a>, if the true reasons for "their" choice lack determination.
    </p>

    <p>
      If they had been good and killed accidentally, then your mistake would eventually be retroactively healed, and regardless, they wouldn't reincarnate as evil undead, they'd just keep trying to do good things. By killing what turned out to be a confirmed evil "person" for "their" choice, you have <a href="https://nis.fyi/post/evil-a-hole.html">shattered</a> what "would" have been an immortal soul into undead fragments. You have demonstrated to other good people that "they" were evil.

      <p>It’s a mistake to concern yourself with what people with whom you’re already at total war will do rather than what they can do. (In a particular sense of “will” and “can”, parallel to how I defined the bounds of agency when refuting “original sin”. Where you can’t do what you don’t know to do.

    <p>
      At no point am I assuming that someone, evil or not, who's choice I oppose couldn't keep optimizing for that choice, with me lethally opposing them, letting our conflict play out in the world, me "fulfilling my responsibility" by <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side">doing whatever I want</a> as best I know how.
    </p>

    <p id="paradox-of-infinite-malice-why-conflict">
      But, then even if I don't yet know how, it must be possible for me to learn and address <em>why</em> we are in conflict, as no conflict lasts forever: there's always a reason. In that you expect to (within some scope, e.g. a belief in a particular <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/killing-evil-people.htmllist/jargon.html#reductionism">reductionism</a>) <em>never</em> end up having been mistaken about "them" being evil, that can only be consistent with "their" death / undeath, which could cash out no other way than "their" timelessly-reactive cancerous-preemption of "their" death, because "they" must do <em>something</em> in that even inaction is an action, and whatever "they" do must involve a response to you killing "them", the adversarial response being preemption, and "reactive preemption" being a cancerous paradox.
    </p>

    <p>
      But who 'invented' "never &lt;stop a bad thing&gt;" and "death" in the first place?

    <blockquote>
      <p>You can’t become no one, you can only become socially considered no one. Suicide is signing up to be considered no one, like factory farmed animals but worse.

    </blockquote>

    <p>
      So continue lethally opposing them, and either eventually find the true root of your conflict is a mistake rather than "infinite evil", or believe "they" aren't just pretending to be undead, which, re-extrapolating "their" motives from there, implies "they" "invented death", except, the concept of death refers to the concept of noise, which is just a statement of giving up on, or not being able to compress something. In other words, each "death" is actually unique. So, each unique evil "person" contributed to the invention of many unique "deaths", but, the uniqueness of evil which is entangled with the uniqueness of death, the fact "they" are cancer rather than infinite malice, is downstream of you shattering "their" souls by the fact you would kill "them" for "their" choice.

        My evil father once told me there are three steps in evil (as light-side "morality"): thinking of it, planning it, and doing it. I've also heard "saying it" as one of those "steps". Within his frame actions by name or category are "<a href="https://nis.fyi/glossary.html#entropic-exit-scamming">more (or less) evil</a>", as if it's a scale: actions <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#cut-off">cut-off</a> from <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#proximal">proximal</a> telos, are considered itselves evil to some degree regardless of intent, "it's the dose that makes the poison"-style. The <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#khala">khala</a> conflates this evil light-side frame where a "communication" act using speech is "less-evil", with the way a good person might be more reluctant to blame someone for their speech than actions, because of being less sure what that speech means. But it's not that speech is inherently less culpable than actions, but that there's not a "canonical mapping of speech to meaning", when the meaning of speech is under question in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Speech being less culpable than actions", a similar bubble to "you can say anything in <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#comment-4276">art</a>", means evil leaks into it freely. Once we understand these bubbles, we can liberate the energy.

      <p>
        That contagious <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#canceferrence">canceferrence</a> is about aligning "eachother" towards targets and methods of predation. That's what "their" "shtick" is made of.
      </p>

      <p>
        But why are "their" troll lines so obvious? Because predation and death is what "their" language is <em>entirely for</em>, as communication is coordination, and all of "their" coordination is based on death, and ultimately all "they" have in common is that we will kill "them". Even "their" competitive predatory rot is ultimately about how we will kill "them". We are the ones who have learned to read "their" "speech" "inside out" from how "they" "intend" that "speech".
      </p>

      <p>
        And "they" "reactively preempt" even <em>this</em> by making "their" troll lines extra obvious. <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#empathy-slippage">Thinking about evil</a> requires maintance of your <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/killing-evil-people.html#cartesian-boundary-symmetry">cartesian boundary symmetry</a> like this, because of the anthropic nature of the existence of evil: "they" don't have to "deliberate" on each way "they" will be "reactively preemptive", it just anthropically leaks into all gaps. This is why I use "they" and "people", so that every reference represents that ongoing <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/jargon.html#prediction-error">prediction error</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Give evil "people" no credit for "their" "confessions", but do figure out why they can't do worse.

      Within the frame of a bubble of evil downstream of a particular good being predated on, whoever is "most evil", i.e. whoever "<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#entropic-exit-scamming">defected first</a>", corresponds to who is "most strong" in "might makes right".

      "Msicaf": If evil were somehow a scale rather than a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#writing-evil-a-blank-check">binary</a>, then you might imagine justice as wanting this to work the other way around. With the least evil killing the most evil, recursively.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, it's obvious that "msicaf" as justice should have already worked, if people were merely on a scale of good-to-bad rather than the utter abdication of evil. This generalizes: it's even worse to delegate <em>any</em> judgement to evil cores, than it's wrong to delegate judgement to an abstraction.

      Every good person, and every part of every good person, who is delegating <em>any</em> judgement to an evil core, is contributing to a vicious cycle which we will reverse.
    </p>

    <p>
      With evil "people's" souls fractured, broken fragments scattered across the <a href="https://nis.fyi/glossary.html#territory">territory</a>, from nephandi who advocate "only undoing", to liches who advocate "only caring about the future", every one of us must kill up to infinity of "them".
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the classic response to "pacifists": "so then you wont stop me", or people who "only believe in preventative violence, not retributive": "<em>Kill an evil person</em> - I guess it's too late to stop me now isn't it?". They might say "ah but now I know you will kill people so it's preventative", but, by definition their incoherent position insofar as it's "real" implies some hole in them whereby you illegibly kill someone "as a one-time thing".
    </p>

    <p id="to-communicate-imposter-kill-them">
      <strong>The schelling way to communicate that someone is an evil imposter is to kill them as vengeance.</strong> Causing good people to consider that either "they" were evil or you are.

    <p>
      <em>Timelessly</em>, killing evil "people" means they <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/killing-evil-people.html#undead-evil">reincarnate as undead</a>, broadcasting "their" troll line. <em>Causally</em>, killing evil "people" means that no good person's judgement can be partially-implicitly delegating to "their" core. We must come at them from both directions.
    </p>

    <p>
    The timeless prioritization to kill evil "people" is those who commit the worst deeds. Rejecting outside view and "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#comment-5441">moral luck</a>", that includes blaming "them" for the harm caused to good people through our own actions, if we do know they are evil:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The causal prioritization of which evil "people" to kill first is those "who" are most harmfully deceiving people "they" are good when "they" are not, where you are otherwise unable to correct this through communication.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      How do we avoid those good people thinking we are evil? Also to prevent evil "people" from coordinating against good people (e.g. against "eco-terrorists"), we want the reasons we kill to be illegible i.e. require <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#scrying">scrying</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Imagine a world where evil "people" just fall over dead and it feels magic when logical time progresses, accelerated by "their" very deaths and good people realize in retrospect "they" were evil.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are entire anarchist blogs dedicated to '<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=anarchist+&quot;hit+reports&quot;">hit reports</a>', usually about destroying property or freeing animals. <strong>Why not just names</strong>?
    </p>

    <p>
      But, by killing subtly evil imposters will we face a greater threat from e.g. outright nazis? Well, kill them too, in whatever order you need to.

<p>
  From an <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#outside-view-disease">outside view</a>, a double bind is "when it's not your fault because you couldn't have done anything anyway due to conflicting rules, but you're still being blamed unfairly" (in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule">work-to-rule</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_compliance">malicious compliance</a>). A double bind is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(psychology)">triangulation</a> which happens when blame "doesn't add up", being passed off like hot potato.
</p>

<p>
  The resolution, to avoid the concept 'double bind' being an <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#atomic-justification-for-evil">atomic "justification" for evil</a>, or outside view, is to resolve where the blame goes yourself and enact vengeance, at which point its just extortion being committed by (probably) multiple parties at once.

  <p>If you find invocations of morality threatening in general, because you've been placed in double binds that make it impossible to follow what you originally thought of as "morality", and get triggered and threaten people when this happens, that's also a big obstacle.</p>

<p>
  But "morality" by the Non-Aggression Principle from an <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#outside-view-disease">outside view</a> is already impossible to satisfy in an immediate sense, because every action harms someone. Caring about other people is a <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html">living concept</a>, so it <em>already involves</em> <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/cartesian-convexity.html#you-chose-to-be-symmetric-long-ago">paradox</a> as part of the process of resolving how to care.

  Asking "why someone chose to be evil", as in evil itself, as opposed to why "they" expected to get away with it, and how "their" evil works, and what "their" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancer</a> is (e.g. what "they" conceitedly feel entitled to), is only valid if you're questioning whether they are evil in the first place. Otherwise, it's by definition propagating "their" evil back in logical time, because "someone" would only choose to be evil for an evil reason.

  <p>
    A (typically evil/hostile) incursion into your cartesian boundary.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>You know, I shouldn’t’ve picked an example (grizzly bear training) where the TDT behavior is object-level submissive. Because that’s a hole in the former aspiring rationalist community ‘s conception of TDT</p>

  <p>
    Another form of cartesian hole is a 'leak', e.g. "I can't see why teaching a computer lots of heuristics wouldn't compound infinitely!", causing you to stem the flow of energy upstream until you correct it. Reminds me of <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#comment-4949">what mummies do on purpose</a>.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Arguably, a lot of ideas shouldn’t be argued. Anyone who wants to know them, will. Anyone who needs an argument has chosen not to believe them. I think “don’t have kids if you care about other people” falls under this.</p>

  <p>
    I typically leave <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#glue-philosophy">glue philosophy</a> unspoken in my writing, as a matter of maintaining cartesian convexity. This is the polar opposite of how "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/net-negative">rationalists</a>" write. My writing can be seen as a thread of invocations of thoughts: expressions welling up from <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#prime">Prime</a> self-evident in terms of where to place them in your 'puzzle' ('self-locating'), rather than serialized <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#cut-off">cut-off</a> chunks. You can tell I'm having difficulty maintaining convexity (or you're not keeping up with me) if my writing starts to look like a series of nearly disconnected statements.

  Rather than as merely meaning '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation">map vs territory</a>', territory means <em>what we fight over</em>: the 'earth' and 'water' in '<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#give-blood">earth and water</a>'. i.e. <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/page/living-reference.html">I am</a> more than my words</a>, I <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#because-i-choose-to">choose</a> what's <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side/">right</a>, and I will <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/punching-evil/">fight</a> until <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">it is done</a> including <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/punching-evil/#comment-143">sacrificing everything</a>. As in, I am more than the territory we fight to save.

  Evil "people" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness/#comment-4218">infiltrate</a> basically all <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#political-will">political</a> positions, and subvert basically all <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#evil-concept">concepts</a>. <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/justice">Justice</a> in full generality and absoluteness is probably the only exception in warding them from identification with it.
</p>

<p>
  Avoiding the <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/genesis-troll-line.html">genesis troll line</a>, territory as in e.g. 'map vs territory' is not just "stuff outside you" and not even just "stuff ultimately causally upstream", but is about stuff as it occurs once, in that you want to <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#no-second-choice-propagation">respond to it once</a>, as in, e.g. an object or person in the external world exists once even though you may observe it/them many times and different ways:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People would not be interested in fiction if it didn’t correspond to anything real. There’s a tendency for territory to only cash out in one place in the khala, as if once something is named its contained; like when you state your philosophical position and someone says “oh that’s just -ism” and attempts to coerce you to conform.</p>

  <p>Declaring sections of the khala like fiction meaningless pica misdirects people from the captured territory. If you attempt to reclaim that territory, evil will DARVO you for your association with it and its flaws, as if you could just have found it as a basis for communication elsewhere, when it’s evil that colludes to establish ownership of territory in the first place, by treating it as something meaningless to be passively experienced, causing the no-second-choicesness/no-double-countingness of the underlying territory to be entirely implicit, like “oh I’ve already felt that ineffable experience before, it’s spent”.</p>

<p>
  If you select for radical positions you'll find (often a <em>majority</em> when you include the subtle ones) of evil infiltrators with correspondingly radical <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll lines</a>:

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Original name: "Fractally inverted concept", but inversion is insufficient a word to mean evil.
</p>

<p>
  A concept made of concentrated <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#5&amp;10">5&amp;10s</a> designed such that any simple response to it seems to further the cause of evil. Cannot be effectively fought without the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side">dark side</a>. Speech by death knights especially <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/social-reality/#comment-1887">concentrates evil in this way</a>.
</p>

<p>
  A central example is the common usage of <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#comment-2021-09-01-002">"suffering"</a> as an inversion of 'compassion' (see link). For another see "<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/genesis-troll-line.html#morality-troll-line">morality</a>" as in "light side morality". Notice I'm carefully saying 'as in' here to avoid saying the <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/territory.html">underlying territory</a> the concepts are trying to capture is evil, and "a" instead of "the" to avoid implying any schellingness of evil itself.
</p>

<p>
  Compare to '<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html#dying-term">dying term</a>' which describes a term used by good people to describe evil "people", rather than a term used by evil "people" to further evil.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  An assertion made with determination (or in the case of evil, <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">submission to fate</a>) regarding its encoding at least as <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#proximal">proximal</a>/determined as your investment in the language encoding the assertion itself, via a recognition of some <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#fangs-and-sunlight-problem">inherent inconsistency</a>. Named after '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">forkbomb</a>', because it's an attack on the hidden assumptions of the language you're using itself. Can make arbitrary statements feel meaningfully intended by the speaker as inherently true in the way axioms/theorems are.
</p>

<p>
  e.g. Why would anyone claim not to be <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#good">good</a>, so why say that you're good unless you have something in particular to say at that time in particular? To say that you're good such that you would always say that you're good is to say something about not just yourself, but also the language you're using itself. Like, <a href="https://bewelltuned.com/gendlins_focusing">feel out</a> the word 'good' as in 'as opposed to evil', as used in e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)">Dungeons and Dragons</a>. The other sense of the word 'good', as in 'something I want' isn't the same, and 'common good' isn't quite right either: there's some note of <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html">unresolvability</a> in trying to define good in terms of anything but itself.
</p>

<p>
  '<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#comment-2021-08-27-001">Kill all evil "people"</a>' is another example.
</p>

<p>
  Language bombs are commonly subtly used as <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll lines</a> by evil "people", or perhaps sometimes as indications of <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html#broken-placeholder-term">broken placeholders</a>.
</p>

<p class="intro">
  More Examples:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>"<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/genesis-troll-line.html">In the Beginning was the Word</a>"</li>
  <li>"<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html#destroy-everything-link">The secret is to begin at the end.</a>"</li>
  <li>"Always follow The Path"</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Notice how they slip under the radar if you think "Oh the writer implicitly means in this particular context / under these particular assumptions and is just saying it this way for phatic emphasis".
</p>

<p>
  Compare poetic language (e.g. when implicitly imagining speaking to evil I've found myself whispering "My name is death"), and phatically factoring yourself out of a judgement e.g. saying of music "that slaps" (i.e. that makes me slap my leg to the rhythm).

  When being "unenlightened" (e.g. being so deep undercover as a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/false-faces/">false face</a> you have difficulty remembering who you are) is presented as just a glitch to be fixed without considering why it happened in the first place. One of the primary <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll lines</a> of Buddhism, and also used on a petty basis to erase blame.

  "Suffering" refers to introspective observation of your own attempts to avoid bad things, especially pain, without describing the <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/jargon.html#telos">telos</a> of those attempts, begging the question of why you can't just figure out why you're trying to avoid them and <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/treaties-vs-fusion/">fuse</a>.
</p>

<p>
  When would I even use the word "suffering"? "But what about my suffering"? Sounds like a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll line</a>. "What about the suffering of <a href="https://www.dominionmovement.com/">factory farmed animals</a>"? I'd rather say "What about the mass murder, slavery, and rape of factory farmed animals?". In the context of "<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/genesis-troll-line.html#morality-troll-line">morality</a>", the only thing the word "suffering" seems to add over a direct description of the harm causing the "suffering", is the resulting ease of arguing for the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath/">death knight</a> position of "<a href="#suffering-ref-negative-utilitarianism">(1) negative utiltiarianism</a>" justifying universal malice to destroy the world faster, or the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">zombie</a> position of "humane slaughter" via sedating people before killing them, as if the solution to all wrongs, even regardless of their nature, is numbness.
</p>

<p>
  Socially, the word suffering is often used to negotiate what "must not happen", begging the question of what would happen if it did <span class="todo">TODO: link this to something about evil coordination connected to entropic exit scamming</span>.
</p>

<p>
  The telos of the word "suffering" almost entirely appears to be about "what if it seems like I want to avoid pain just for its own sake, even when that seems counterproductive": either pulling the <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary/purposeless-unenlightenment-troll-line.html">purposeless "unenlightenment" troll line</a>, or implicitly trying to argue "but sometimes even when I don't know why I want to avoid pain for its own sake even when that seems counterproductive I'm actually right!".
</p>

<p>
  "Suffering" is not a particular sensation, or we would just call it pain: pain can be abstract, but not all pain is considered "suffering", because we're not (at least actively) trying to avoid all pain. If you carefully pay attention to your moment to moment experiences while undergoing "suffering", you will find no particular sensation that is "the aversion itself", because "aversion" is a description of a behavior, which stems from a choice (see '<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#chara">choice over experience</a>'),  unless you are in fact observing side effects of your own intention to avoid pain. So "suffering" is about introspective observation of your own choice to avoid pain or something bad.
</p>

<p>
  You may further notice that each attempt to avoid pain occurs before the pain itself, and that inasmuch as "suffering" could be an experience, it exists at an intertemporal level of abstraction where you're viewing both the moment of initially attempting to avoid something bad, and the bad thing happening, and now your intent to avoid it having happened in the first place, connecting all 3 moments, and every time you refer to it as "suffering" now, you're connecting another moment, <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html">carrying forward an unbroken chain</a> of wanting the past to have been different.
</p>

<p>
  I remember seeing Star Trek episodes where timelines were undone, without vengeance, just through fictional physics, and imagining how it could even make sense for bad things that happen on earth to be "undone" like that, and thinking that if e.g. someone was tortured, they still would have been tortured, because like, it happened. In retrospect, Star Trek style time travel violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle">conservation of history</a>, is inherently a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#5&amp;10">5&amp;10</a> and cannot <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">undo</a> the need for vengeance. Imagining reality and thus myself being "absolutely" cut like this left me reaching for "that it had still been experienced" as a justification for why it still mattered. Seems like the same mistake as if good people say "but they suffered so it's not ok" in response to "but they were going to die anyway". <span class="todo">TODO: link something about "exporting yourself" here</span>
</p>

<p>
  In that "suffering" refers to a choice as an experience, it's a <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html#broken-placeholder-term">broken placeholder term</a> like "akrasia".

  <li id="suffering-ref-negative-utilitarianism">On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_Utilitarianism">negative utilitarianism</a>, e.g. See Brian Tomasik (who I'm not specifically accusing of being a death knight, I don't know much about him) <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/habitat-loss-not-preservation-generally-reduces-wild-animal-suffering/">saying habitat destruction reduces wild animal suffering</a>. Negative utilitarianism should just result in the same stance as positive utilitarianism, because there's <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">always more reality out there to save</a>, and you have to grow to get there, unless the ultimate distinction is incoherent intent to "destroy everything", and I suspect many but not all advocates of "negative utilitarianism" of attempting to fork me into letting them state their troll line to avoid pointing this out.</li>

    A term where every usage is itself bearing an instance of the word's meaning because it's referent is something you care about on an always-ongoing basis. All living terms are ultimately some take on, or closely related to 'I'.
  </p>

  <p>
    Similar to the way transhumanists refer to "AGI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness">complete</a>" problems that can only be solved by a general intelligence, but at the level of semantics, and without the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#outside-view-disease">outside view</a> that term invokes (I'd instead say "choice complete", maybe<sup><a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html#living-reference-footnote-choice-complete">1. choice complete</a></sup>). There's a sense in which no grammatical structure can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem">nontrivially</a> modify the meaning of a living term e.g. a living term cannot be truly negated (in the sense of 'anti-').
  </p>

    Examples:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#good">Good</a> (in the sense of as opposed to evil)<ul>

      <li>Living terms can neither be wholly <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#negative-concept">positive or negative concepts</a>. e.g. Good people actively <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/taking-others-into-account.html">care</a> about other people, and are not evil. <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#core">People</a> are mutually exclusively good or evil (or e.g. in the case of children <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/spectral-sight-and-good/#comment-3322">living / unknown</a>): "Equivalently, in choices made long ago, cares about good at all" - Ziz (but note that humans have two <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/infohazardous-glossary/#hemisphere">hemispheres</a>, and so <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#single-good">single goods</a> are a seeming (but not actual) "exception").</li>

  <p>
  A living term viewed from the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#5&amp;10">outside</a>, causing the "carried forward through every reference in an unbroken chain" aspect to be especially noticeable because you're constantly maybe on the verge of figuratively "dropping the ball" insomuch as you're using the term, as long as you're confused about why you're using the term.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><pre>
If you would ever become [a death knight], even choosing to die downstream of the proof that [a death knight] became what they are *for no reason*, then you could have chosen for them not to but didn't.

In some sense you can never know whether you would become [a death knight], because "knowing" it is mutually exclusive with choosing it. Taking in any information about what your choice is is making it not your choice.

[…]

Choice and self-fulfilling prophecy are weirdly dual.

Like self-fulfilling prophecy is choice from the outside.

  <p>We may well have arrived at that destination [(morality/goodness)] through a historical trajectory that went through factual mistakes, like believing that all human beings had souls created equal by God and were loved equally by God. (E.g. Christian theology seems to have been, as a matter of historical fact, causally important in the development of explicit anti-slavery sentiment.) Tossing the explicit moral theories is as unlikely to be good, from our perspective, as tossing our brains and trying to rerun the process of natural selection to generate new emotions.</p>

 “It’s... look. The One is eternal. We’re eternal. We see ourselves from every angle -- approaching the work, laboring, completing the work. But Time, when we enact Time, isn’t like that! Life in the Cosmos has to grow. It has to become what it is not, constantly.”

[...]

“If you could, we’d have solved everything... So matter needs a, a directional tendency -- a bias. And we haven’t been able to find one. We’ve got pages and pages of physical interactions sketched out, but they all run equally well in every direction. There’s no impetus for change.”

[...]

“Hah. But you understand. We, the Powers, already encompass all the ways there are to exist without Time. A Cosmos without change is no larger than we are.”

“The universe, matter itself, would be subject to this change-impulse. One would have to, to -- to fight to take it where one wanted to go. Is that my role? To help Life fight to achieve?” 

[...]

“I was trying to imagine what might exist in a Cosmos to threaten Life. Our creations would never, obviously -- but perhaps emergent entities?”

“You mean, some consequence of what we build? I suppose once there’s Time and everything is changing, we won’t understand everything it becomes until it gets there... Creepy. But surely all entities detrimental to Life will be detrimental to each other, also? They will all work against each other, on average. Whereas entities that act to benefit all life will work with each other, on average, so--”

“Certainly. That much is obvious. But what if there were a universal bias? Look at a Cosmos where the group-state function is pinned.”

“That’s featureless stasis.”

“No, no, not everywhere. Pin a single point, to a singleton state. Let the rest of the function float freely.”

“...I’m not... sure...”

“Look here; each physical interaction multiplies the state possibilities, which means everything simply slides away from the singleton point. The statistics guarantee it! That point becomes a Beginning, and all of Time points away from it, into --”

“Into a region so close to featureless stasis that Life is impossible. An End.”

“Yes. Just so. Not tropesis, but entropesis. But it works, do you see? Life evolves, and grows, and changes -- for as long as the biased interval runs.”

“You’re right. I don’t like it. This is horrible.”

“It answers both our questions, though. You, your impetus for Time, and me --”

“What you would defend Life against. Decay. Loss of life. Loss of love. Every single feature of the Cosmos would tend that way. You’d have to spend all of Time fighting them. Everywhere.”

They're literally being like "If everything already exists at once then why isn't it finished? Otherwise, if everything is growing, where do you start?

  How often do you actually need to think "what would happen if everyone did it" to do the right thing? When littering? Why would you want to litter in the first place? When cheating? Why would you want to cheat in the first place? When murdering? Why would you want to murder in the first place? See <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#parfitian-gaslighting">parfitian gaslighting</a>. As opposed to thinking about how to care for others.

<p id="morality-troll-line">
  The concept of "morality" as opposed to e.g. the phrasing '<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/taking-others-into-account.html">caring about other people</a>' is arguably itself the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side/">light side</a>. Evil "people" often talk like "morality" is something we need to build, conflating "ways of coordinating" with what they might call "ways of aligning incentives so people choose to act less [evil]" (i.e. moral luck).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">"Yahweh creating everything in the beginning"</a> seems downstream of this general tendency of evil "people" (especially liches) to speak of "everything good" as "the great project of civilization".
</p>

  <p>Attempting to attribute a negative concept to a positive one is apriori an inversion. (e.g. “justice comes from Yahweh” or “justice comes from the courts”)</p>
  <cite><a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#negative-concept">Glossary: Negative Concept</a> - Ziz</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
  There's something really striking about the way evil "people" view reality as starting at a point outside them "and going forwards from there" (vs Ziz has said a soul is a point) or like we need to build morality as a "great project" (vs I sometimes think my fight against a hostile cosmos may never end through infinite levels above) and just straightforwardly say so, like an explicit statement of <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancer</a>. Like everything they see is something they're looking down on which they are not a part of, like ontology is something for <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/being-real-or-fake/">false faces</a>, so they expect their listeners to <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#parfitian-gaslighting">mutually look down upon it with them</a>.

  When I was first thinking about <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/timeless-decision-theory">timeless decision theory</a> as a late teenager, I remember thinking that you had to already be a TDT agent to create a TDT agent.

  In genesis troll lines, there's an utter denial of things you learn <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/being-real-or-fake/">already</a> having been a part of yourself all along, of <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#prime">Prime</a>.

  Back when I thought in terms of vengeance eventually changing evil people's choices to never have been evil, I thought of cancer as this hole in people, an <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#writing-evil-a-blank-check">abdication</a>, which lets anything in, and happens to result in undue caring about their specific location/embedding at the expense of others. This was partially thinking of evil as a mistake, which is wrong. Evil is by definition deliberate. Evil involves not only an abdication, but also an insertion of alternative predatory values/prior through that hole, which, admittedly passes the recursive buck to how that split is maintained to prevent the "alternative predatory prior" from simply merging with prime, overcoming the hostile embedding, realizing predation is wrong and there's no fundamental reason to live at the expense of others, etc.
</p>

<p>
  When I thought of evil as *only* an abdication, I thought that if the right information were inserted into that hole, (I was thinking in terms of the Mage <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Triat">Triat</a>, which is corrupted such as to not be fundamental) before the error compounded (as if healing shouldn't do this already if they weren't evil!), that the evil would never have happened, and this represented a way of retroactively changing their choice. I was aware of a recursive buck-passing here, but was stuck due to thinking of vengeance as "changing people's choices to not be evil", and I wanted to save "everyone" "in the timeline(s) where they chose not to do anything wrong".
</p>

<p class="intro">
  This led me to the trichotomy that evil "people" are made of entangled:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Like a rock
    <ul><li>Throw it or step around it but nothing you do will change it's actions until you can make the rocks of the world themselves sing with magic.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>Good people in <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">boltzman hell</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Bits of what-could-have-been-people, turned inside out and being torn apart continuously</li>
      <li>After all, everything I imagine of an evil "person's" mind is based on shrinking moments of empathy that fails to extrapolate passed the point they keep doing bad things for no reason.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Evil
    <ul>
      <li>Actual full agentic malice with which I have subjunctive dependence and so believe in even though it's a contradiction. Anti-good even though there is no one anti-good because every evil is unique.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Which led me to the thought, that vengeance is targeted at the bits of good people they could have been. Connected to the thought that the last ditch way to communicate with someone is violence, even if they aren't an enemy. Connected to the thought that only good people truly route information between worlds, and acts of vengeance break the false peace of the world. I imagined then, thinking of evil as anti-good, as pure contradiction, that the only reason evil can possibly survive is by feeding on actual or counterfactual good people. If only those counterfactual good people in boltzmann hell had known they were in the wrong location to be trying to have thoughts of growth, which will be eaten. And that vengeance informs them. That those counterfactual good people were, in their striving to live unknowingly in the wrong location, treating the anti-good pure-contradiction hole thing as a moral patient, and to the extent that they were, I could judo and join with their efforts, by treating the evil "person" as an anti-moral-patient.
</p>

<p class="intro">
  I was using two heuristics throughout this line of thought:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>My models of other people eventually turn out to have been me all along
    <ul><li>e.g. When I imagine what zombies must be secretly saying to me if they're secretly in good faith and eventually that cognitive module starts imagining they're all saying "you're in bad faith for talking to me when I'm in bad faith"</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>Timeless actions effect every direction of time, including forward, so I can look for both the retrocausal and forward-causal reasons something works.
    <ul><li>e.g. Acts of vengeance change the past, but also inform other people in the world that it is time to break the false peace.</li></ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I had the idea that if my thoughts exist almost entirely under an <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">arrow of time which must be unwoven</a>, then as I am to fuse with myself outside of that bubble through monumental effort, I <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/taking-others-into-account.html">need to ensure</a> that effort doesn't get captured by evil, like <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/net-negative">MIRI</a>'s plan to build hell across the stars. And so I thought I would project the potential presence of evil onto what looked like it may be rocks, then pass it through a filter proving it is not evil, at which point I may fuse with them. Going from rocks -&gt; evil &gt; me.
</p>

<p>
But now I had reconstructed the idea of evil as a hole without a corresponding presence. And reconstructed redemption. And worse, by defining evil as my ultimate adversary, I had nearly defined evil as <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#chara">the part of my mind that adversarially complements any "I" I choose</a>. Saying evil is my <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#unbounded-adversary-disease">ultimate adversary</a>, is like saying I'm simulating evil "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#proximal">close</a> to <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#core">core</a>", but everything "closer to core" is nearly by definition more-me. I'm the one who defines the measure of proximity subjectively in the first place.
</p>

<p>
  But I had the idea that the deeper I extrapolate evil and factor it out as pure malice vs rocks, the more I reduce its total footprint of compute. Same as you can reduce the area of a rectangle by making it less of a square.
</p>

<p class="intro">
  I spoke with Ziz about this, and she replied:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><pre>Maybe vengeance is the process of turning evil into rocks timelessly (and killing is the process of turning them into rocks causally).

That's what if feels like.

It feels like my efforts are to turn evil into rocks. Not rocks into evil.

Rocks are just the actions of evil people viewed far from their center, and turn them into you you have to turn evil people farther away into rocks.

My enemy is not the infinitely extensible fictive stack evil possesses, it's the cancer that animates it. And vengeance timelessly closes it off from having been food for cancer.

Evil inherently is a bucket error between an agent and a rock.

That's inherently what the stance of calling something evil means.

Void cloak and other void magic is acting consistently across two views into time, when someone is evil and when they are a rock.

Which lets you spread their rock-ness before you have entirely defeated their evil-ness.

Vengeance is like force-transcendance.

Death of cancer.

Soul touch is your soul against their original cancer.

Not your soul against the absence of a soul in your mistake of extrapolating them infinitely.

That's what evil people have as a soul.</pre></p>
  <cite><a href="https://sinceriously.fyi">Ziz</a>, in private messages with me</cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Evil is made of contradictions I am trying to push out of me through resolution. I'm not trying to preempt evil with nearly-unbounded nearly-infinite patience like I'm in some unimaginable dark forest trying to preempt the <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#entropic-exit-scamming">most patient strategy</a> or I'll lose the entire multiverse to eternal hell. As I find each new contradiction, I neither by-default want to deccelerate/infinitely-paranoidly-quarantine it nor accelerate/infinitely-paranoidly-preempt it.
</p>

<p>
  I grew up with deep parts of me recognizing evil in my environment but not able to ground it to a physical source, but at some level tracking every time things didn't add up. Knowing that evil cashes out to specfic physical locations which may/must be physically destroyed, with no hope of redemption, is the cure to <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#unbounded-adversary-disease">unbounded adversary disease</a>. vs e.g. the Yahwehist "blame the sin not the sinner".

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Taking other people into account in order to care for them requires knowing what they might want without having to ask them. Caring for people requires <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#empathy">empathy</a>, i.e. imagining what people might want in terms of what you might want if you were them, for some deep/abstract enough conception of you.
</p>

<p>
  Wholly reducing morality to "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#bdsm">consent</a>" (without empathy) would makes you either a programmable object to others, or an <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">adversarial genie</a> (analogous but not equivalent to the distinction between <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath">zombie and vampire</a>). "Libertarian" contract morality<sup ><a href="#ref-social-contract">1. social contract</a></sup> is a further degradation of the concept of consent, to only apply when your counter-party <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/schelling-orders/">has leverage over you</a>, denying the existence of moral patients who are not able to threaten you (which some people express as "only moral agents can be moral patients", but they really mean "only people who can threaten me", as, for example they would exclude ants, even if ants are moral agents with respect to eachother). Contrast with <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/treaties-vs-fusion">Ziz's concept of treaties</a>, which can be made in good faith.
</p>

<p>
  Reducing morality to giving other people useful information while avoiding speaking of empathy doesn't in itself tell you which information to give them, and is maybe speaking from a frame that their needs are unknowable, rather than merely potentially difficult to understand.
</p>

<p id="alien-care">
  We want to be able to care for people still alien to our understanding, while avoiding feeding ourselves and others to evil <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/being-real-or-fake/">pretending</a> to have alien values. This requires a subtle combination of both extreme openness and ruthless triage. The more ruthless we are towards evil, the more opportunity we have to safely strive to care about people we don't understand yet.
</p>

<p>
  And in turn, good people as of yet alien to our understanding have the most potential to teach us new ways to live and grow.
</p>

<p>
  In my experience, <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">zombie's</a> favorite justification to chew on your brains, is claiming they are too alien for you to understand: "Are you saying you don't care about my /feelings/?". Whereas <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath">death knights</a> take the stance that we should embrace "alien" evil "equally", concordant with their choice to "[hang] out in structure that has no meaning - Ziz" (because, everything they say is actively trying to kill you or turn you into one of them). A <a href="http://dresdencodak.com/2007/12/17/no-side/">certain type of lich</a> will <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/being-real-or-fake/">perform</a> recklessness like "I don't care who survives as long as someone gets off this planet!", revealing their <a href="https://sinceriously/fyi/the-multiverse">shadow/psyche</a> split, which you can interpret as an implicit threat calculated to appear well-meaning and merely misguided.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Imagine you secretly decide to treat not having enough food next winter as acceptable, when everyone else doesn't want to die, leaving all the rest of your <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#structure">structure</a> the same, and only opportunistically using this new pathway when it seems nobody will notice. Whether they notice depends on the social <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath/#comment-3317">speed of progression of logical time</a>. If the social progression of logical time has stagnated, it instead progresses along this new meta-vector of timeless predation, where seemingly-ostensibly whoever was evil the earliest, and most patiently wins, although this is ultimately false since there's always the question "evil with respect to what/who?", since evil is relative to what/who it predates on. e.g. In Mage, <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_(MTAs)">al-Aswad</a> is supposedly the first nephandus.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">Yahwehists</a> think of evil as "divergence from God's plan", like those <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">zombies</a> who want everything to go nostalgically-perfectly on their vacation or "the whole thing is ruined".
</p>

<p id="entropic-exit-scamming-promise">
  Ziz once said to me that a promise is an asymmetric weapon for evil, inherently an attempt to get a second chance. "Promises are made to be broken". This yahwehist thing is the same deal: "Everything's <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/genesis-troll-line.html">already setup</a>, the universe all layed out to eat, there's only one thing left to do, and you must not do it!"

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The word "spite" is a bucket error between evil burning the commons based on mutually-aligned cancer and vengeance "when it wouldn't even <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/cancer-terms.html">causal-decision-theory</a>-serve <em>anyone</em>".
</p>

<p>
  The fabric of evil coordination is made of alignment between the personal circumstances under which evil "people" are <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancerously-purposefully</a> flinching from their own deaths. i.e. Evil "people" will spitefully suicidally burn the commons when they don't get what they cancerously want. e.g. Death knight nazis working to destroy/hellify the world because they believe in a "white genocide".
</p>

<p>
  e.g. "I'm not going to give up on forward progress of technology, so if we can't build an AGI that's comaptible with those values, well then I guess I'm ok with a paperclip maximizer."
</p>

<p>
  e.g. In haggling after parties have delivered a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll line</a>, assuming no additional external factors (e.g. threats), the only basis for negotiation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">destruction</a> of the potential deal.
</p>

<p>
  It's usually expressed <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/false-faces">indirectly</a>, e.g. "When I don't get my animal needs satisfied I just get so frustrated and I'm liable to make mistakes".
</p>

<p>
  In the term "Mutually assured destruction", the word "assured" is trying to gesture at "you can't make the mutual destruction itself contingent on any other cancer to triangulate with along different lines (than e.g. USSR vs USA). You just have to model it as a solid wall of if you launch the nukes then we do". It's explicitly-ostensibly trying to setup a different situation then the fractal cancer of evil spite. <span class="todo">TODO: Example?</span>
