        If <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#praxis">praxis</a> is about 'How can we build something here that would work anywhere?', exporting yourself is writing a blank check to <em>only</em> doing that, rather than in fusion with survival, preventing you from having secrets or a 'payload' to deliver (see <a href="glossary.html#retirement-troll-line">retirement troll line</a>).

          <p>The GSV never really knew why it did what it did next; perhaps it was a kind of desperation at work born of its appreciation of its impending destruction, perhaps it meant it as an act of defiance, perhaps it was even something closer to an act of art. Whatever; it took the running up-date of its mind-state, the current version of the final signal it would ever send, the communication that would contain its soul, and transmitted it directly ahead, signalling it into the maelstrom</p>

          In my <a href="glossary.html#suffering-star-trek-time-travel">Suffering: Star Trek Time Travel</a> example, the 5&amp;10 of considering the "previous" timeline to be cut-off oblivioned out of existence begets trying to preserve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle">conservation of history</a> through the zero-measure aperature (<span class="todo">TODO: connect this to reductionism and cancer</span>) of "caring about experience".

          Zombies wanting a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#flower">flower</a> on them after they die, like the trope that your last experience is felt forever in death, seems almost like a phylactery. i.e. Consider the trope that the "next cycle" of the universe will be <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#canceferrence">based</a> on a tally of who "won" in the last. Seems like a place where the line between zombie and lich blurs.

          <p>
            Zombies will actually care more if you shoot them in the head, then put a flower on them and say "rest in peace" as opposed to shooting them in the head and then roaring, "burn in hell you piece of shit!"<br />
            And all evil has a little bit of zombie in it.<br />
            One of those things actually makes more effective vengeance, because in the former case they know they have bought you for an intended order of the multiverse where they get uploaded from a Schelling last instant of their life where they pretend they weren't disgusting.<br />
            Or bought a fraction of you.<br />
            But it's not the specifics that matter, it's the intention to send them to hell. To reunite them with their shadows. That's what they're trying to buy off, that's what they're trying to affect, by memeing you into thinking a good person would give them a "clean death".<br />
            Like them caring what you say after you shoot them in the head is kind of rational, that's where their awareness that they still exist after you shoot them in the head goes. Boltzmann Hell is different if you say one thing or another.
