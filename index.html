          A concept I first conceived in childhood. Makes sleeping difficult for me. I think most people generate some version of this concept in childhood. The concept of 'absoluteness' (in general) must come from within you, and is <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/absolute">near to 'freedom'</a>.

          Good people don't "<a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">retire</a>". Equivalently, good people don't judge someone else as good, without retaining the ability to change their mind.

        <p class="intro">Examples:</p>

        <p>
          MIRI <a href="post/genesis-troll-line.html#miri-perfect-being">wanted</a> to have an artificial intelligence (i.e. a "perfect being") analyze humans' brains, to figure out what they want and then do that, calling it "value loading".
        </p>

        <p>
          The trope where someone sees ascension as creating the "perfect human" or the "perfect being" to replace them (but oh no! it turns out to have cancer too!).

          Rather than as merely meaning '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation">map vs territory</a>', territory means <em>what we fight over</em>: the 'earth' and 'water' in '<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#give-blood">earth and water</a>'. i.e. <a href="page/living-reference.html">I am</a> more than my words</a>, I <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#because-i-choose-to">choose</a> what's <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side/">right</a>, and I will <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/punching-evil/">fight</a> until <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">it is done</a> including <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/punching-evil/#comment-143">sacrificing everything</a>. As in, I am more than the territory we fight to save.

          Evil "people" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness/#comment-4218">infiltrate</a> basically all <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#political-will">political</a> positions, and subvert basically all <a href="glossary.html#evil-concept">concepts</a>. <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/justice">Justice</a> in full generality and absoluteness is probably the only exception in warding them from identification with it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Avoiding the <a href="post/genesis-troll-line.html">genesis troll line</a>, territory as in e.g. 'map vs territory' is not just "stuff outside you" and not even just "stuff ultimately causally upstream", but is about stuff as it occurs once, in that you want to <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#no-second-choice-propagation">respond to it once</a>, as in, e.g. an object or person in the external world exists once even though you may observe it/them many times and different ways:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>People would not be interested in fiction if it didn’t correspond to anything real. There’s a tendency for territory to only cash out in one place in the khala, as if once something is named its contained; like when you state your philosophical position and someone says “oh that’s just -ism” and attempts to coerce you to conform.</p>

          <p>Declaring sections of the khala like fiction meaningless pica misdirects people from the captured territory. If you attempt to reclaim that territory, evil will DARVO you for your association with it and its flaws, as if you could just have found it as a basis for communication elsewhere, when it’s evil that colludes to establish ownership of territory in the first place, by treating it as something meaningless to be passively experienced, causing the no-second-choicesness/no-double-countingness of the underlying territory to be entirely implicit, like “oh I’ve already felt that ineffable experience before, it’s spent”.</p>

          Neither nominally advocating against death, nor nominally advocating for <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">retrocausal</a> optimization even in the face of death is sufficient to exclude evil positions.

          Original name: "Fractally inverted concept", but inversion is insufficient a word to mean evil.
        </p>

        <p>
          A concept made of concentrated <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#5&amp;10">5&amp;10s</a> designed such that any simple response to it seems to further the cause of evil. Cannot be effectively fought without the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side">dark side</a>. Speech by death knights especially <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/social-reality/#comment-1887">concentrates evil in this way</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A central example is the common usage of <a href="glossary.html#comment-2021-09-01-002">"suffering"</a> as an inversion of 'compassion' (see link). For another see "<a href="post/genesis-troll-line.html#morality-troll-line">morality</a>" as in "light side morality". Notice I'm carefully saying 'as in' here to avoid saying the <a href="post/territory.html">underlying territory</a> the concepts are trying to capture is evil, and "a" instead of "the" to avoid implying any schellingness of evil itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compare to '<a href="list/living-reference.html#dying-term">dying term</a>' which describes a term used by good people to describe evil "people", rather than a term used by evil "people" to further evil.

          An assertion made with determination (or in the case of evil, <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">submission to fate</a>) regarding its encoding at least as <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#proximal">proximal</a>/determined as your investment in the language encoding the assertion itself, via a recognition of some <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#fangs-and-sunlight-problem">inherent inconsistency</a>. Named after '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">forkbomb</a>', because it's an attack on the hidden assumptions of the language you're using itself. Can make arbitrary statements feel meaningfully intended by the speaker as inherently true in the way axioms/theorems are.
        </p>

        <p>
          e.g. Why would anyone claim not to be <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#good">good</a>, so why say that you're good unless you have something in particular to say at that time in particular? To say that you're good such that you would always say that you're good is to say something about not just yourself, but also the language you're using itself. Like, <a href="https://bewelltuned.com/gendlins_focusing">feel out</a> the word 'good' as in 'as opposed to evil', as used in e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)">Dungeons and Dragons</a>. The other sense of the word 'good', as in 'something I want' isn't the same, and 'common good' isn't quite right either: there's some note of <a href="list/living-reference.html">unresolvability</a> in trying to define good in terms of anything but itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          '<a href="glossary.html#comment-2021-08-27-001">Kill all evil "people"</a>' is another example.
        </p>

        <p>
          Language bombs are commonly subtly used as <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll lines</a> by evil "people", or perhaps sometimes as indications of <a href="list/living-reference.html#broken-placeholder-term">broken placeholders</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="intro">
          More Examples:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>"<a href="post/genesis-troll-line.html">In the Beginning was the Word</a>"</li>
          <li>"<a href="list/living-reference.html#destroy-everything-link">The secret is to begin at the end.</a>"</li>
          <li>"Always follow The Path"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Notice how they slip under the radar if you think "Oh the writer implicitly means in this particular context / under these particular assumptions and is just saying it this way for phatic emphasis".
        </p>

        <p>
          Compare poetic language (e.g. when implicitly imagining speaking to evil I've found myself whispering "My name is death"), and phatically factoring yourself out of a judgement e.g. saying of music "that slaps" (i.e. that makes me slap my leg to the rhythm).
