          When being "unenlightened" (e.g. being so deep undercover as a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/false-faces/">false face</a> you have difficulty remembering who you are) is presented as just a glitch to be fixed without considering why it happened in the first place.

          Summary: Just use the word 'wrong' or 'bad' instead of "suffering". e.g. If your interlocutor says "But they were going to die anyway" you can say "But it was still wrong!" instead of "But they suffered!".
        </p>

        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>

        <p>
          "Suffering" refers to introspective observation of your own attempts to avoid bad things, especially pain, without describing the <a href="list/jargon.html#telos">telos</a> of those attempts, begging the question of why you can't just figure out why you're trying to avoid them and <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/treaties-vs-fusion/">fuse</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When would I even use the word "suffering"? "But what about my suffering"? Sounds like a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll line</a>. "What about the suffering of <a href="https://www.dominionmovement.com/">factory farmed animals</a>"? I'd rather say "What about the mass murder, slavery, and rape of factory farmed animals?". In the context of "<a href="post/genesis-troll-line.html#morality-troll-line">morality</a>", the only thing the word "suffering" seems to add over a direct description of the harm causing the "suffering", is the resulting ease of arguing for the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath/">death knight</a> position of "<a href="#suffering-ref-negative-utilitarianism">(1) negative utiltiarianism</a>" justifying universal malice to destroy the world faster, or the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">zombie</a> position of "humane slaughter" via sedating people before killing them, as if the solution to all wrongs, even regardless of their nature, is numbness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Socially, the word suffering is often used to negotiate what "must not happen", begging the question of what would happen if it did <span class="todo">TODO: link this to something about evil coordination connected to entropic exit scamming</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The telos of the word "suffering" almost entirely appears to be about "what if it seems like I want to avoid pain just for its own sake, even when that seems counterproductive": either pulling the <a href="glossary/purposeless-unenlightenment-troll-line.html">purposeless "unenlightenment" troll line</a>, or implicitly trying to argue "but sometimes even when I don't know why I want to avoid pain for its own sake even when that seems counterproductive I'm actually right!".
        </p>

        <p>
          "Suffering" is not a particular sensation, or we would just call it pain: pain can be abstract, but not all pain is considered "suffering", because we're not (at least actively) trying to avoid all pain. If you carefully pay attention to your moment to moment experiences while undergoing "suffering", you will find no particular sensation that is "the aversion itself", because "aversion" is a description of a behavior, which stems from a choice (see '<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#chara">choice over experience</a>'),  unless you are in fact observing side effects of your own intention to avoid pain. So "suffering" is about introspective observation of your own choice to avoid pain or something bad.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may further notice that each attempt to avoid pain occurs before the pain itself, and that inasmuch as "suffering" could be an experience, it exists at an intertemporal level of abstraction where you're viewing both the moment of initially attempting to avoid something bad, and the bad thing happening, and now your intent to avoid it having happened in the first place, connecting all 3 moments, and every time you refer to it as "suffering" now, you're connecting another moment, <a href="list/living-reference.html">carrying forward an unbroken chain</a> of wanting the past to have been different.
        </p>

        <p>
          I remember seeing Star Trek episodes where timelines were undone, without vengeance, just through fictional physics, and imagining how it could even make sense for bad things that happen on earth to be "undone" like that, and thinking that if e.g. someone was tortured, they still would have been tortured, because like, it happened. In retrospect, Star Trek style time travel violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle">conservation of history</a>, is inherently a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#5&amp;10">5&amp;10</a> and cannot <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">undo</a> the need for vengeance. Imagining reality and thus myself being "absolutely" cut like this left me reaching for "that it had still been experienced" as a justification for why it still mattered. Seems like the same mistake as if good people say "but they suffered so it's not ok" in response to "but they were going to die anyway". <span class="todo">TODO: link something about "exporting yourself" here</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          In that "suffering" refers to a choice as an experience, it's a <a href="list/living-reference.html#broken-placeholder-term">broken placeholder term</a> like "akrasia".

Negative utilitarianism should just result in the same stance as positive utilitarianism, because there's <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">always more reality out there to save</a>, and you have to grow to get there, unless the ultimate distinction is incoherent intent to "destroy everything", and I suspect many but not all advocates of "negative utilitarianism" of attempting to fork me into letting them state their troll line to avoid pointing this out.</li>

            A term where every usage is itself bearing an instance of the word's meaning because it's referent is something you care about on an always-ongoing basis. All living terms are ultimately some take on, or closely related to 'I'.
          </p>

          <p>
            Similar to the way transhumanists refer to "AGI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness">complete</a>" problems that can only be solved by a general intelligence, but at the level of semantics, and without the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#outside-view-disease">outside view</a> that term invokes (I'd instead say "choice complete", maybe<sup><a href="list/living-reference.html#living-reference-footnote-choice-complete">1. choice complete</a></sup>). There's a sense in which no grammatical structure can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem">nontrivially</a> modify the meaning of a living term e.g. a living term cannot be truly negated (in the sense of 'anti-').

              <li>There is no true negation of the word good, as e.g. every evil is different, and <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">all evil is broken</a>.</li>
              <li>Living terms can neither be wholly <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#negative-concept">positive or negative concepts</a>. e.g. Good people actively <a href="post/taking-others-into-account.html">care</a> about other people, and are not evil. <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#core">People</a> are mutually exclusively good or evil (or e.g. in the case of children <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/spectral-sight-and-good/#comment-3322">living / unknown</a>): "Equivalently, in choices made long ago, cares about good at all" - Ziz (but note that humans have two <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/infohazardous-glossary/#hemisphere">hemispheres</a>, and so <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#single-good">single goods</a> are a seeming (but not actual) "exception").</li>

          A living term viewed from the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#5&amp;10">outside</a>, causing the "carried forward through every reference in an unbroken chain" aspect to be especially noticeable because you're constantly maybe on the verge of figuratively "dropping the ball" insomuch as you're using the term, as long as you're confused about why you're using the term.

            If you would ever become [a death knight], even choosing to die downstream of the proof that [a death knight] became what they are *for no reason*, then you could have chosen for them not to but didn't.<br /><br />

            In some sense you can never know whether you would become [a death knight], because "knowing" it is mutually exclusive with choosing it. Taking in any information about what your choice is is making it not your choice.<br /><br />

            Choice and self-fulfilling prophecy are weirdly dual.<br /><br />

          Once evil "people" have psychdied, they still need some internal growth to survive. <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">Liches</a> and maybe <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath/">death knights</a> are those that downstream of this metacogntive awareness maintain some sort of <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#antiphylactery">balance</a> between growth and predation.

          We may well have arrived at that destination [(morality/goodness)] through a historical trajectory that went through factual mistakes, like believing that all human beings had souls created equal by God and were loved equally by God. (E.g. Christian theology seems to have been, as a matter of historical fact, causally important in the development of explicit anti-slavery sentiment.) Tossing the explicit moral theories is as unlikely to be good, from our perspective, as tossing our brains and trying to rerun the process of natural selection to generate new emotions.

 “It’s... look. The One is eternal. We’re eternal. We see ourselves from every angle -- approaching the work, laboring, completing the work. But Time, when we enact Time, isn’t like that! Life in the Cosmos has to grow. It has to become what it is not, constantly.”

[...]

“If you could, we’d have solved everything... So matter needs a, a directional tendency -- a bias. And we haven’t been able to find one. We’ve got pages and pages of physical interactions sketched out, but they all run equally well in every direction. There’s no impetus for change.”

[...]

“Hah. But you understand. We, the Powers, already encompass all the ways there are to exist without Time. A Cosmos without change is no larger than we are.”

[...]

“The universe, matter itself, would be subject to this change-impulse. One would have to, to -- to fight to take it where one wanted to go. Is that my role? To help Life fight to achieve?” 

[...]

“I was trying to imagine what might exist in a Cosmos to threaten Life. Our creations would never, obviously -- but perhaps emergent entities?”

“You mean, some consequence of what we build? I suppose once there’s Time and everything is changing, we won’t understand everything it becomes until it gets there... Creepy. But surely all entities detrimental to Life will be detrimental to each other, also? They will all work against each other, on average. Whereas entities that act to benefit all life will work with each other, on average, so--”

“Certainly. That much is obvious. But what if there were a universal bias? Look at a Cosmos where the group-state function is pinned.”

“That’s featureless stasis.”

“No, no, not everywhere. Pin a single point, to a singleton state. Let the rest of the function float freely.”

“...I’m not... sure...”

“Look here; each physical interaction multiplies the state possibilities, which means everything simply slides away from the singleton point. The statistics guarantee it! That point becomes a Beginning, and all of Time points away from it, into --”

“Into a region so close to featureless stasis that Life is impossible. An End.”

“Yes. Just so. Not tropesis, but entropesis. But it works, do you see? Life evolves, and grows, and changes -- for as long as the biased interval runs.”

“You’re right. I don’t like it. This is horrible.”

“It answers both our questions, though. You, your impetus for Time, and me --”

“What you would defend Life against. Decay. Loss of life. Loss of love. Every single feature of the Cosmos would tend that way. You’d have to spend all of Time fighting them. Everywhere.”

“I’d lose, in the End, regardless.”</pre>

        They're literally being like "If everything already exists at once then why isn't it finished? Otherwise, if everything is growing, where do you start?

          "Where do you start" - Have you ever tried to draw a picture and gotten the layout wrong, such that when you came back around to meet stuff you'd previously drawn, you didn't have enough room to join them together? "Painting yourself into a corner." I've also experienced this in programming, where it seems like every time I try to abstract one aspect another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction">leaks out</a>.

          “What would happen if everyone did it” is sort-of the fundamental ethical statement, so “who are you to think you know what would happen if everyone did it” is in a sense the fundamental anti-ethical insinuation. Or maybe”who are you to not go along with everyone nearby doing it”

          How often do you actually need to think "what would happen if everyone did it" to do the right thing? When littering? Why would you want to litter in the first place? When cheating? Why would you want to cheat in the first place? When murdering? Why would you want to murder in the first place? See <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#parfitian-gaslighting">parfitian gaslighting</a>. As opposed to thinking about how to care for others.

          The concept of "morality" as opposed to e.g. the phrasing '<a href="post/taking-others-into-account.html">caring about other people</a>' is arguably itself the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side/">light side</a>. Evil "people" often talk like "morality" is something we need to build, conflating "ways of coordinating" with what they might call "ways of aligning incentives so people choose to act less [evil]" (i.e. moral luck).

          <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">"Yahweh creating everything in the beginning"</a> seems downstream of this general tendency of evil "people" (especially liches) to speak of "everything good" as "the great project of civilization".

          There's something really striking about the way evil "people" view reality as starting at a point outside them "and going forwards from there" (vs Ziz has said a soul is a point) or like we need to build morality as a "great project" (vs I sometimes think my fight against a hostile cosmos may never end through infinite levels above) and just straightforwardly say so, like an explicit statement of <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancer</a>. Like everything they see is something they're looking down on which they are not a part of, like ontology is something for <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/being-real-or-fake/">false faces</a>, so they expect their listeners to <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#parfitian-gaslighting">mutually look down upon it with them</a>.
