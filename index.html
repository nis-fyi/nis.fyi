          <p>
            A (typically evil/hostile) incursion into your cartesian boundary.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>You know, I shouldn’t’ve picked an example (grizzly bear training) where the TDT behavior is object-level submissive. Because that’s a hole in the former aspiring rationalist community ‘s conception of TDT</p>

          <p>
            Another form of cartesian hole is a 'leak', e.g. "I can't see why teaching a computer lots of heuristics wouldn't compound infinitely!", causing you to stem the flow of energy upstream until you correct it. Reminds me of <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#comment-4949">what mummies do on purpose</a>.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Arguably, a lot of ideas shouldn’t be argued. Anyone who wants to know them, will. Anyone who needs an argument has chosen not to believe them. I think “don’t have kids if you care about other people” falls under this.</p>

            I typically leave <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#glue-philosophy">glue philosophy</a> unspoken in my writing, as a matter of maintaining cartesian convexity. This is the polar opposite of how "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/net-negative">rationalists</a>" write. My writing can be seen as a thread of invocations of thoughts: expressions welling up from <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#prime">Prime</a> self-evident in terms of where to place them in your 'puzzle' ('self-locating'), rather than serialized <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#cut-off">cut-off</a> chunks. You can tell I'm having difficulty maintaining convexity (or you're not keeping up with me) if my writing starts to look like a series of nearly disconnected statements.
