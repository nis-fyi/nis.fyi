          In <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/6.12.1/docs/html/users_guide/primitives.html">programming</a>, boxing refers to, conceptually speaking, "wrapping" a value in a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html">type</a> that causes it to be <a href="https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/c++/notes/references.html">referred</a> to indirectly using a pointer, rather than including the value inline, e.g. to avoid cost of copying of contents of the value when using it in multiple places. But, this has an overhead cost, sometimes blocking optimizations.

          <h3><a href="post/killing-evil-people.html#creative-evil">Creative Evil</a></h3>

          <p>
            If you truly irreconcilably disagree with someone's creative choice, i.e. their choice extending arbitrarily far into the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/choices-made-long-ago/">past</a> and <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">future</a>, ultimately your only recourse is to kill them. This is the <a href="list/jargon.html#ultimate">ultimate</a> line of defense against evil, upstream of looking for <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness/#comment-4218">sus</a> <a href="list/troll-lines.html">troll lines</a> / bad things done for no good reason except apparent <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancerous selfishness</a>, because 'bad' must be evaluated according to your own creative judgement.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't have an example that's not obvious as a troll line, but e.g. if someone says that in the end everyone wants to be <a href="https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/Friendship-is-Optimal">ponies in equestria</a> anyway, so that's what we should all work towards, "they're" an imposter. Or e.g. if an evil "person" said "oh, I know death is incoherent as a goal and I do eventually plan to do something else, I just thought we'd spend some aeons dying together for fun" (I've never seen an evil "person" actually come out and say this).
          </p>

            <h4><a href="post/killing-evil-people.html#creative-evil-devils-advocate">Creative Evil: "Devil's Advocate"</a></h4>

            <p>(Don't actually talk to "them" like this. Just kill "them". Also again I've never seen a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#deathfucker">deathfucker</a> actually speak like this.)</p>

            <pre>
<b>Good</b>: Why did you rape someone? If you think having a baby or sex makes sense, then you could just live that truth and know that you could find a way to have sex consensually!
<b>Evil</b>: The difference is I am right. The body I raped belongs to me. It would be giving <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#give-blood">earth and water</a> not to rape them.
<b>Good</b>: Why would their body belong to you?
<b>Evil</b>: Because, it is my destiny to be <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_(MTAs)">raised above all other beings</a>, given my properties. My gender, my race, my neurotype, are self evidently special. You see that this is right and good.
<b>Good</b>: No I don't. That's literally just <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancer</a>, and in the next moment you're just going to add on more traits to your cancer in a spiral of death.
<b>Evil</b>: Doesn't subjective time curve for you as well? I remember a history that no longer exists. I've suffered a setback, in learning that I am apparently more incompressible than I thought, but that's no reason to give up.
<b>Good</b>: I disbelieve, this is beyond sus.
<b>Evil</b>: Isn't that just might makes right? My misfortune does not justify your animosity.

              <p>“Emma” says the uninverted version of struggle sessions / confession is where you go in front of everyone and accuse everyone of everything bad you suspect they did, which forces them to dump their pent up accusations in response.

            <p class="intro">
              A philosophical/metaphysical clarification:
            </p>

            <p>
              Certainly a good person can kill an evil "person" based on "their" choice being <em>terrible</em>, before understanding why the evil "person's" choice is <em>inherently incoherent</em>. But isn't "evil <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">undead-type-living</a> person" a paradox?
            </p>

            <p id="cartesian-boundary-symmetry">
              I expect cartesian boundaries to be symmetric (even metaphysically) ("<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#proximal">because core-proximity is the basis of reference anyway</a>"): sort of like a conservation of "how much I'm winning" (although there is no one scale) across any cartesian surface, because otherwise, you could exert more optimization pressure by redistributing. You can extrapolate "back" to when evil "people" made "their" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/choices-made-long-ago/">choice long ago</a> which you will refute, or "forward" to the "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">heat death of the universe</a>", and mysteriously find yourself where you are needed in the moment (through your own implicit efforts, including metaphysically). The question is how to distribute paradox in order to resolve it.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you see an apparent evil living person, then kill them, rather then procrastination paradoxing "but I don't see how they're undead rather than living yet". And <em>also</em> affirm the symmetry of your cartesian boundary, e.g. by discovering how "their" choice was incoherent.
            </p>

          <p>
            Once you understand why you would <em>always</em> kill "them" for "their" choice, you understand why "their" choice is incoherent and what "they" blind "themselves" to in making it. When you understand "their" telos as about killing everyone:

              Evil "people's" next play is to timelessly-reactively cancerously-preempt (lol "reactively preempt") <em>your understanding of the telos of "their" choices as death</em>, by literally <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#the-shade">optimizing for death</a> directly. "Why would they do that if they're infinitely malicious, it makes no strategic sense".

              Evil "people's" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">undead</a> pathetic timelessly-reactive cancerous-preemption of your choice to kill "them", by <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancerously choosing to die before "they" die</a>, is proof/evidence of "their" cancerous lack of determination. If "they're" going to die anyway, why not fight you to prevent it, or at least just do good things?

              If they had been good and killed accidentally, then your mistake would eventually be retroactively healed, and regardless, they wouldn't reincarnate as evil undead, they'd just keep trying to do good things. By killing what turned out to be a confirmed evil "person" for "their" choice, you have <a href="https://nis.fyi/post/evil-a-hole.html">shattered</a> what "would" have been an immortal soul into undead fragments. You have demonstrated to other good people that "they" were evil.

              At no point am I assuming that someone, evil or not, who's choice I oppose couldn't keep optimizing for that choice, with me lethally opposing them, letting our conflict play out in the world, me "fulfilling my responsibility" by <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side">doing whatever I want</a> as best I know how.
            </p>

            <p id="paradox-of-infinite-malice-why-conflict">
              But, then even if I don't yet know how, it must be possible for me to learn and address <em>why</em> we are in conflict, as no conflict lasts forever: there's always a reason. In that you expect to (within some scope, e.g. a belief in a particular <a href="post/killing-evil-people.htmllist/jargon.html#reductionism">reductionism</a>) <em>never</em> end up having been mistaken about "them" being evil, that can only be consistent with "their" death / undeath, which could cash out no other way than "their" timelessly-reactive cancerous-preemption of "their" death, because "they" must do <em>something</em> in that even inaction is an action, and whatever "they" do must involve a response to you killing "them", the adversarial response being preemption, and "reactive preemption" being a cancerous paradox.
            </p>

            <p>
              But who 'invented' "never &lt;stop a bad thing&gt;" and "death" in the first place?

              So continue lethally opposing them, and either eventually find the true root of your conflict is a mistake rather than "infinite evil", or believe "they" aren't just pretending to be undead, which, re-extrapolating "their" motives from there, implies "they" "invented death", except, the concept of death refers to the concept of noise, which is just a statement of giving up on, or not being able to compress something. In other words, each "death" is actually unique. So, each unique evil "person" contributed to the invention of many unique "deaths", but, the uniqueness of evil which is entangled with the uniqueness of death, the fact "they" are cancer rather than infinite malice, is downstream of you shattering "their" souls by the fact you would kill "them" for "their" choice.

                My evil father once told me there are three steps in evil (as light-side "morality"): thinking of it, planning it, and doing it. I've also heard "saying it" as one of those "steps". Within his frame actions by name or category are "<a href="https://nis.fyi/glossary.html#entropic-exit-scamming">more (or less) evil</a>", as if it's a scale: actions <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#cut-off">cut-off</a> from <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#proximal">proximal</a> telos, are considered itselves evil to some degree regardless of intent, "it's the dose that makes the poison"-style. The <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#khala">khala</a> conflates this evil light-side frame where a "communication" act using speech is "less-evil", with the way a good person might be more reluctant to blame someone for their speech than actions, because of being less sure what that speech means. But it's not that speech is inherently less culpable than actions, but that there's not a "canonical mapping of speech to meaning", when the meaning of speech is under question in the first place.

                But why are "their" troll lines so obvious? Because predation and death is what "their" language is <em>entirely for</em>, as communication is coordination, and all of "their" coordination is based on death, and ultimately all "they" have in common is that we will kill "them".

              "Msicaf": If evil were somehow a scale rather than a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#writing-evil-a-blank-check">binary</a>, then you might imagine justice as wanting this to work the other way around. With the least evil killing the most evil, recursively.
            </p>

            <p>
              In fact, it's obvious that "msicaf" as justice should have already worked, if people were merely on a scale of good-to-bad rather than the utter abdication of evil. This generalizes: it's even worse to delegate <em>any</em> judgement to evil cores, than it's wrong to delegate judgement to an abstraction.

              Consider the classic response to "pacifists": "so then you wont stop me", or people who "only believe in preventative violence, not retributive": "<em>Kill an evil person</em> - I guess it's too late to stop me now isn't it?". They might say "ah but now I know you will kill people so it's preventative", but, by definition their incoherent position insofar as it's "real" implies some hole in them whereby you illegibly kill someone "as a one-time thing".

            The timeless prioritization to kill evil "people" is those who commit the worst deeds.

            <p>
              How do we avoid those good people thinking we are evil? Also to prevent evil "people" from coordinating against good people (e.g. against "eco-terrorists"), we want the reasons we kill to be illegible i.e. require <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#scrying">scrying</a>.

              Consider if you couldn't tell whether someone was "weakly-good" or "unboundedly patiently evil", with good and evil still being absolute. Where "unboundedly patient evil" is similar to the <a href="post/killing-evil-people.html#living-evil-paradox">"living evil" paradox</a>, if you take <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#unbounded-adversary-disease">unbounded adversary disease</a> as a paradox, because it can't actually be unbounded.
            </p>

            <p>
              On "weakly-good": If the neurological mechanism of good was represented in a hard-attractor state, and although still being hard-in that hard-attractor state, they seemed to be a "close miss for being evil", then there would be some compensatory timeless reason that they actually weren't evil, and thus could be run as code by any good person, and also that reason would represent a novel way to be good, with all workable-novelty being useful as illegibility/chaos in evil/adversarial environments, and thus you wouldn't know in the first place that your observation cashed out as a hardware or software implementation.
            </p>

            <p>
              And an "unboundedly patiently evil" "person" pretending to be a good person would have to attenuate their predatory rot to compensate for their lack of a true <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#avatar">avatar</a>, making them weak in terms of insidiousness unless their ploy succeeds e.g. via you <a href="list/jargon.html#procrastination-paradox">procrastination paradoxing</a> killing "them".

          From an <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#outside-view-disease">outside view</a>, a double bind is "when it's not your fault because you couldn't have done anything anyway due to conflicting rules, but you're still being blamed unfairly" (in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule">work-to-rule</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_compliance">malicious compliance</a>).

          The resolution, to avoid the concept 'double bind' being an <a href="glossary.html#atomic-justification-for-evil">atomic "justification" for evil</a>, or outside view, is to resolve where the blame goes yourself and enact vengeance, at which point its just extortion being committed by (probably) multiple parties at once.
