          The word "spite" is a bucket error between evil burning the commons based on mutually-aligned cancer and vengeance "when it wouldn't even <a href="list/cancer-terms.html">causal-decision-theory</a>-serve <i>anyone</i>".
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The fabric of evil coordination is made of alignment between the personal circumstances under which evil "people" are <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancerously-purposefully</a> flinching from their own deaths. i.e. Evil "people" will spitefully suicidally burn the commons when they don't get what they cancerously want. e.g. Death knight nazis working to destroy/hellify the world because they believe in a "white genocide".
        </p>
        
        <p>
          e.g. "I'm not going to give up on forward progress of technology, so if we can't build an AGI that's comaptible with those values, well then I guess I'm ok with a paperclip maximizer."
        </p>
        
        <p>
          e.g. In haggling after parties have delivered a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll line</a>, assuming no additional external factors (e.g. threats), the only basis for negotiation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">destruction</a> of the potential deal.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          It's usually expressed <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/false-faces">indirectly</a>, e.g. "When I don't get my animal needs satisfied I just get so frustrated and I'm liable to make mistakes".
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In the term "Mutually assured destruction", the word "assured" is trying to gesture at "you can't make the mutual destruction itself contingent on any other cancer to triangulate with along different lines (than e.g. USSR vs USA). You just have to model it as a solid wall of if you launch the nukes then we do". It's explicitly-ostensibly trying to setup a different situation then the fractal cancer of evil spite. <span class="todo">Example?</span>

        <p>
          Any definition given for the cancerous versions of these concepts will be insufficient to describe how quickly the meaning of their usage (by evil people) will decay (i.e. how quickly they become "simulacra"). <span class="todo">link metasyntactic</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Some of these terms / concepts may have valid non-cancerous definitions, or be used as accusations of cancer against good people (e.g. "you revel in vengeance!"). <span class="todo">Link how evil uses mistakes as cover</span>
