  Yeah I'm sure this is evil: 1. "Their" primary self declared motive is simply true friendship. 2. "commitment" is an inverted formulation of choice 3. "They" say there's nothing in particular we need to do, with no mention of justice 4. "They" advocate destroying everything. See: <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#territory">Glossary: Territory</a>.

  "Suffering" is commonly used as an <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#evil-concept">evil concept</a>, i.e. <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#entropic-exit-scamming">designed</a> such that any response to it seemingly furthers the cause of evil:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I said "I don't care about suffering, I care about life", they could say "Oh so you're <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#comment-2021-08-26-002">against compassion</a>".</li>
  <li>If I said "If life is suffering then I want to maximize suffering", they could say "Oh so you want to create hell for everyone forever, then everyone will eventually consent to die".</li>
  <li>If I said "I want to minimize suffering in that I want to minimize the harm that causes suffering", they could say "Well suffering is harm, and the best way to minimize that harm is to end all life".</li>
  <li>If I said "suffering doesn't exist", they could say "Oh, so compassion doesn't exist".</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">Zombies, liches, and death knights</a> all seem to agree on the prime goal of "eliminating suffering".
</p>

<p>
  And if I say I'm "pro-life" this <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#deathfucker">deathfucking</a> society will interpret that as being about abortion.

  This is the <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html#destroy-everything-link">second</a> evil article I've linked to which advocates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTOWIMJkKpc">killing everyone</a>.

  Don't kill everyone. Kill all evil <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/evil-a-hole.html">"people"</a>. Don't kill "everyone besides <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html">yourself</a>", even if you are good:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We want to be able to care for people still alien to our understanding, while avoiding feeding ourselves and others to evil <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/being-real-or-fake/">pretending</a> to have alien values. This requires a subtle combination of both extreme openness and ruthless triage. The more ruthless we are towards evil, the more opportunity we have to safely strive to care about people we don't understand yet.</p>

  <p>that inasmuch as "suffering" could be an experience, it exists at an intertemporal level of abstraction where you're viewing both the moment of initially attempting to avoid something bad, and the bad thing happening, and now your intent to avoid it having happened in the first place, connecting all 3 moments</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  "Suffering" is concept very close to (self-)compassion (<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html#broken-placeholder-term">viewed from the outside</a>), and saying you want to eliminate all suffering (rather than the wrong its responding to), is very similar to saying you want to eliminate all compassion.
</p>

<p>
  Reminds me of:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, when the <a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Guhyasamaja_Tantra" title="Guhyasamaja Tantra">Guhyasamaja Tantra</a> requires of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adept" title="wikipedia:adept">adept</a> that “he should kill all <a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Sentient_beings" title="Sentient beings">sentient beings</a> with this secret <a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Thunderbolt" title="Thunderbolt">thunderbolt</a>” (<a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Wayman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="broken-link" title="Wayman (page does not exist)">Wayman</a>, 1977, p. 309), then — according to <a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Doctrine" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a> — this should occur so as to free them from <a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Suffering" title="Suffering">suffering</a>.</p>

  Star Trek style time travel violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle">conservation of history</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Most "people" I talk to about undoing timelines, even when I explain I mean making the past retroactively inonsistent, even when I reference the <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/">Functional Decision Theory</a> paper and they are familiar with it, act like I mean Star Trek style time travel. In <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/">compatibalism regarding free will</a>, there's the realization that free will <em>requires</em> determinism in that it requires your choices to have the capacity to be based on <em>reasons</em>. The realization here is similar: undoing the past <em>couldn't</em> work unless it is <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#fictive">fictive</a>, i.e. unless you choose to refute the world you've "observed".
