  Yudkowsky is invested in "playful" (as in "even evil people still have a sense of humor") storytelling as a response to <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#dead-silence">dead silence</a>. e.g. See this <a href="https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/post/181121498760/v-hey-siddy-guess-what-happened-with-that-luke">Star Wars microfic</a>.
</p>

  Seems like an expression of how he's endlessly <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#lock-on">stuck</a> on the concept of "moral patiency" wrt zombies playing utility monsters <span class="todo">TODO: link</span>. Like his <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#default-interlocutor">default interlocutor</a> needs to be convinced of what's reasonable and can be swayed by <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#give-blood">paying tribute</a> via such a simple <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/jargon.html#goodhart">goodharting</a>.

  Statism involves routing every "<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#suffering-must-not-happen">must not happen</a>" to a political schelling point, and to a person to be <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#double-bind">fake blamed</a> (see also: <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#redress-diode">redress diode</a>). This abdication in routing blame represented as a <em><a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#negative-concept">need to route to a specific target</a></em> is in essence <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/punching-evil/#comment-956">what the state <em>is</em></a> psychologically.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Consider if you couldn't tell whether someone was "weakly-good" or "unboundedly patiently evil", with good and evil still being absolute. Where "unboundedly patient evil" is similar to the <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/killing-evil-people.html#living-evil-paradox">"living evil" paradox</a>, if you take <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#unbounded-adversary-disease">unbounded adversary disease</a> as a paradox, because it can't actually be unbounded.
</p>

<p>
  On "weakly-good": If the neurological mechanism of good was represented in a hard-attractor state, and although still being hard-in that hard-attractor state, they seemed to be a "close miss for being evil", then there would be some compensatory timeless reason that they actually weren't evil, and thus could be run as code by any good person, and also that reason would represent a novel way to be good, with all workable-novelty being useful as illegibility/chaos in evil/adversarial environments, and thus you wouldn't know in the first place that your observation cashed out as a hardware or software implementation.
</p>

<p>
  And an "unboundedly patiently evil" "person" pretending to be a good person would have to attenuate their predatory rot to compensate for their lack of a true <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#avatar">avatar</a>, making them weak in terms of insidiousness unless their ploy succeeds e.g. via you <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/jargon.html#procrastination-paradox">procrastination paradoxing</a> killing "them".
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    The causal prioritization of which evil "people" to kill first is those "who" are most harmfully deceiving people "they" are good when "they" are not, where you are otherwise unable to correct this through communication.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Every <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#entropic-exit-scamming">utter abdication</a>, implies positive-evil <em>would</em> leak in <em>anthropically</em>. Relatedly, <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/caring.html">caring</a> about other people involves <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#scrying">scrying</a> their avatar, which is also necessary to judge them. And conversely, judging them <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/evil-a-hole.html">is part of</a> scrying their avatar. And that judgement is only real, if it could lead to vengeance.

"Hurt people hurt people" - I once saw on "accelerationist" twitter someone say that if you believe Roko's Basilisk will "[~happen]" you are an enemy. vs Consider <q>Worshiping a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/infohazardous-glossary#god">god</a> is the things you do when you route your hopes through it. This strengthens that god.</q> - <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/infohazardous-glossary/#worship">Infohazardous Glossary: Worship</a> - Ziz.
</p>

<p>
  Evil "people" aware of of cybernetics / <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#perceptual-control">perceptual control</a> often frame "hurt people hurt people" in terms of the "top level" of someone's mind predicting bad things means doing bad things:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world goes from a place where e.g. the Catholic church covering up sex abuse is *anomalous* to one where it's *expected*.  There's a figure-ground inversion, where transgression and cover-ups seem like the *main* thing, not an anomaly.</p>
  <p>…</p>
  <p>If you find invocations of morality threatening in general, because you've been placed in double binds that make it impossible to follow what you originally thought of as "morality", and get triggered and threaten people when this happens, that's also a big obstacle.</p>
  <cite><a href="https://twitter.com/jessi_cata/status/1445465587023446017">Jesica Taylor</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>
  But people have free will. The "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#cut-off">top level</a> of your mind" being <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#entropic-exit-scamming">invertable</a> like this if you lose hope is pretty much the definition of a lich.
</p>

<p>
  The concept "placed in double binds" here is being used as an <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html">atomic "justification" for evil</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">
  On paradoxes:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphenomenalism">Epiphenomenalism</a> violates cartesian convexity via outright claiming souls have a <em>specific</em> and one-way-disconnected inside and outside, rather than being atomic and contiguous.
</p>

<p>
  Consider how you would even pose the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a>", without violating cartesian convexity.
</p>

<p>
  Regarding compatibalism between "free will vs determinism", we already naively expected in the first place that choices must have the capacity to have be made for reasons. "Determinism" here is actually referring to the <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/genesis-troll-line.html">genesis troll line</a>, or imagining that the future absolutely cannot effect the past, or imagining entirely causally containing someone indefinitely and being able to totally preempt their actions (<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#canceferrence">making them a slave</a>?), which makes "free will vs determinism" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#paradox-misattribution">paradox misattribution</a>. I remember considering it like "well I guess the only alternative to being deterministic would be being random, weird that it was almost like I used to <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/ancient-wisdom-fixed/">believe in a third category</a>". Calling compatibalism a "solution" then buries that lingering confusion.
</p>

<p>
  Also consider the relation between "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">philosophical zombies</a>" and what it means to lack an <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#avatar">avatar</a>. And the relation between "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">solipsism</a>" and <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/post/cartesian-convexity.html#redistribution-by-taking-credit">paradox redistribution by taking credit</a>.

  Like, try analyzing words by how you learned them:
</p>

<p>
  'Pain' is bottom-up, a metaphor for nociception. You learn the word in the context of stubbing your toe.
</p>

<p>
  'Diswant' is top-down relative to pain. You learn the term 'don't want' in the context of delegating carrying out your choices to other people.
</p>

<p>
  You learn the term "suffering" in the context of <em>justifying</em> why you deserve something even though someone has already denied you.

  This glossary entry was dually-inspired by <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/punching-evil/#comment-2345">Vassar's</a> use of his term "evolutionary spite strategies" to explain his concept of the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#shade">Shade</a>, and my usage of it when arguing to what-I-now-know-are-<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#deathfucker">deathfuckers</a> that yes people do things that "don't make CDT sense".
</p>

<p>
  I see that now Vassar is throwing the word "compassion" under the bus instead of reclaiming it. It's like he's imported some sort of "yes this is oppositeland".
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Michael Vassar:<br />
    It’s not about numbers. And ‘smart’ doesn’t really get to the heart of it either.
  Everyone starts out basically selfish, but that’s the same thing as starting life aligned and pro-social. To some extent everyone succumbs to trauma and becomes less selfish and more nihilistic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Liminal Warmth:<br />
    That's a very grim way to see maturity and compassion 😅
  </p>

  <p>
    Michael Vassar:<br />
    Yeah, maturity and compassion are an evolutionary spite strategy related to territorial dominance. If cashed out as philosophy they are omnicidal intent, and the Vedic cultures do cash them out that way theologically. Decency and non-familial benevolence are neotenous.
  </p>

  Yeah I'm sure this is evil: 1. "Their" primary self declared motive is simply true friendship. 2. "commitment" is an inverted formulation of choice 3. "They" say there's nothing in particular we need to do, with no mention of justice 4. "They" advocate destroying everything.

  "Suffering" is commonly used as an <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#evil-concept">evil concept</a>, i.e. <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#entropic-exit-scamming">designed</a> such that any response to it seemingly furthers the cause of evil:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>If I said "I don't care about suffering, I care about life", they could say "Oh so you're <a href="https://www.nis.fyi/glossary.html#comment-2021-08-26-002">against compassion</a>".</li>
  <li>If I said "If life is suffering then I want to maximize suffering", they could say "Oh so you want to create hell for everyone forever, then everyone will eventually consent to die".</li>
  <li>If I said "I want to minimize suffering in that I want to minimize the harm that causes suffering", they could say "Well suffering is harm, and the best way to minimize that harm is to end all life".</li>
  <li>If I said "suffering doesn't exist", they could say "Oh, so compassion doesn't exist".</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">Zombies, liches, and death knights</a> all seem to agree on the prime goal of "eliminating suffering".
</p>

<p>
  And if I say I'm "pro-life" this <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#deathfucker">deathfucking</a> society will interpret that as being about abortion.

  <p>We want to be able to care for people still alien to our understanding, while avoiding feeding ourselves and others to evil <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/being-real-or-fake/">pretending</a> to have alien values.

  <p>that inasmuch as "suffering" could be an experience, it exists at an intertemporal level of abstraction where you're viewing both the moment of initially attempting to avoid something bad, and the bad thing happening, and now your intent to avoid it having happened in the first place, connecting all 3 moments</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  "Suffering" is concept very close to (self-)compassion (<a href="https://www.nis.fyi/list/living-reference.html#broken-placeholder-term">viewed from the outside</a>), and saying you want to eliminate all suffering (rather than the wrong its responding to), is very similar to saying you want to eliminate all compassion.
</p>

<p>
  Reminds me of:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, when the <a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Guhyasamaja_Tantra" title="Guhyasamaja Tantra">Guhyasamaja Tantra</a> requires of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adept" title="wikipedia:adept">adept</a> that “he should kill all <a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Sentient_beings" title="Sentient beings">sentient beings</a> with this secret <a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Thunderbolt" title="Thunderbolt">thunderbolt</a>” (<a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Wayman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="broken-link" title="Wayman (page does not exist)">Wayman</a>, 1977, p. 309), then — according to <a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Doctrine" title="Doctrine">doctrine</a> — this should occur so as to free them from <a href="http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Suffering" title="Suffering">suffering</a>.</p>

  Star Trek style time travel violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle">conservation of history</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
  Most "people" I talk to about undoing timelines, even when I explain I mean making the past retroactively inonsistent, even when I reference the <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/">Functional Decision Theory</a> paper and they are familiar with it, act like I mean Star Trek style time travel. In <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/">compatibalism regarding free will</a>, there's the realization that free will <em>requires</em> determinism in that it requires your choices to have the capacity to be based on <em>reasons</em>. The realization here is similar: undoing the past <em>couldn't</em> work unless it is <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#fictive">fictive</a>, i.e. unless you choose to refute the world you've "observed".
