        <p>“Are you pro-choice or pro-life?”<br />
        I favor both life and choice.</p>
        <p>“Are you an antinatalist, or a human supremacist?”<br />
        Neither.</p>
        <p>“You wouldn’t download an abortion of baby Hitler”<br />
        Yes I would.</p>

            <p>Given evil “people” unperson animals for not having “complex enough nervous systems”, I don’t trust their evaluations of when a fetus becomes a person.<br />
            I’m not a “negative utilitarian” or “antinatalist”.<br />
            I will destroy carnism because it’s evil and because I don’t want people to be harmed.<br />
            Intent to predate / harm another person in self-conceit is evil. In general the phrasing ‘harm an innocent’, refers to ‘aggressive harm’ refers to predation / <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">malicious cancerous intent</a>.</p>
            <p>I wont be tricked into saying that it’s “ok” (what would that even mean?) to kill an arbitrary/unknown person because they are “are in the median case evil”.</p>
            <p>Neither will I be tricked into avoiding sharing weapons/tools-of-death even if they can only be used on people of unknown alignment, given the location of those people (e.g. in a good person’s womb) can be known, and that can be relevant in judgement.</p>
            <p>If I share information on abortion, maybe it will end up being useful to good people:</p>

        <p>I meant written porn in particular, and I particularly meant evil, as in, I’m pretty sure there’s rare porn out there by some living or good people. I haven’t watched much videos of people having sex.</p>

        <p>“Is there <i>anything</i> wrong with it/this” is perhaps my most robust (and thus maybe most compounding) mental ability. Doesn’t automatically tell me details of what about it that’s wrong; doesn’t mean I automatically know what to do instead.</p>

        <p>People would not be interested in fiction if it didn’t correspond to anything real. There’s a tendency for territory to only cash out in one place in the khala, as if once something is named its contained; like when you state your philosophical position and someone says “oh that’s just -ism” and attempts to coerce you to conform.</p>

        <p>Declaring sections of the khala like fiction meaningless pica misdirects people from the captured territory. If you attempt to reclaim that territory, evil will DARVO you for your association with it and its flaws, as if you could just have found it as a basis for communication elsewhere, when it’s evil that colludes to establish ownership of territory in the first place, by treating it as something meaningless to be passively experienced, causing the no-second-choicesness/no-double-countingness of the underlying territory to be entirely implicit, like “oh I’ve already felt that ineffable experience before, it’s spent”.</p>

            <p>Evil then covertly uses such “ineffable experiences” as the basis for political decision making, calling it culture, art, and values. Weaving a tapestry of once-cashed-out ostensibly-black-box territory diluted with deliberate errors. And will accuse you of disrespecting/destroying illegible value (i.e. in the case of evil, cancer) for trying to make sense of its correspondance to politics.</p>

            <p>So if you focus on politics directly, you’ll be led around in circles stepping around “ineffable values”, and if you attempt to understand art and culture, you’ll be DARVO’d for its cringe and pica.</p>

            <p>I have meaningful-i.e.-understandable feelings about art and fiction, based on the territory it corresponds to, despite cringe etc. Seeing Ziz show the source code for her thoughts is an easy to read signal that she’s good.</p>
