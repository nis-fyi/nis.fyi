(so you should avoid knowing)" (rather than shoulder the responsibility, or be willing to lie about knowing). Examples: "<a href="https://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethics/">copenhagen morality</a>", "laws you're only culpable for if you know about them", a doctor telling you not to get an STD test for HPV because then you'll need to disclose if it's positive which the doctor says "isn't fair because HPV is so common".

          See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind">Double Bind</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          From an <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#outside-view-disease">outside view</a>, a double bind is "when it's not your fault because you couldn't have done anything anyway due to conflicting rules, but you're still being blamed unfairly" (in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule">work-to-rule</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_compliance">malicious compliance</a>). A double bind is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulation_(psychology)">triangulation</a> which happens when blame "doesn't add up", being passed off like hot potato.
        </p>

        <p>
          The resolution, to avoid the concept 'double bind' being an <a href="../../glossary.html#atomic-justification-for-evil">atomic "justification" for evil</a>, or outside view, is to resolve where the blame goes yourself and enact vengeance, at which point its just extortion being committed by (probably) multiple parties at once. Analogous to people trying to saidar-circumvent "copyright" by <a href="https://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/entry/23">sharing two XOR-halves separately</a>.

        <blockquote>
          <p>If you find invocations of morality threatening in general, because you've been placed in double binds that make it impossible to follow what you originally thought of as "morality", and get triggered and threaten people when this happens, that's also a big obstacle.</p>

        <p>
          But "morality" by the Non-Aggression Principle from an <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#outside-view-disease">outside view</a> is already impossible to satisfy in an immediate sense, because every action harms someone.

          Asking "why someone chose to be evil", as in evil itself, as opposed to why "they" expected to get away with it, and how "their" evil works, and what "their" <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancer</a> is (e.g. what "they" conceitedly feel entitled to), is only valid if you're questioning whether they are evil in the first place. Otherwise, it's by definition propagating "their" evil back in logical time, because "someone" would only choose to be evil for an evil reason.

          Original name: "Fractally inverted concept", but inversion is insufficient a word to mean evil.
        </p>

        <p>
          A concept made of concentrated <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#5&amp;10">5&amp;10s</a> designed such that any simple response to it seems to further the cause of evil. Cannot be effectively fought without the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side">dark side</a>. Speech by death knights especially <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/social-reality/#comment-1887">concentrates evil in this way</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A central example is the common usage of <a href="../../glossary.html#comment-2021-09-01-002">"suffering"</a> as an inversion of 'compassion' (see link). For another see "<a href="../../post/genesis-troll-line.html#morality-troll-line">morality</a>" as in "light side morality". Notice I'm carefully saying 'as in' here to avoid saying the <a href="../../post/territory.html">underlying territory</a> the concepts are trying to capture is evil, and "a" instead of "the" to avoid implying any schellingness of evil itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compare to '<a href="../../list/living-reference.html#dying-term">dying term</a>' which describes a term used by good people to describe evil "people", rather than a term used by evil "people" to further evil.

          Summary: Just use the word 'wrong' or 'bad' instead of "suffering". e.g. If your interlocutor says "But they were going to die anyway" you can say "But it <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#because-i-choose-to">was still</a> wrong!" instead of "But they suffered!".
        </p>

        <p>
          "Suffering" refers to introspective observation of your own attempts to avoid bad things, especially pain, without describing the <a href="../../list/jargon.html#telos">telos</a> of those attempts, begging the question of why you can't just figure out why you're trying to avoid them and <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/treaties-vs-fusion/">fuse</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When would I even use the word "suffering"? "But what about my suffering"? Sounds like a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll line</a>. "What about the suffering of <a href="https://www.dominionmovement.com/">factory farmed animals</a>"? I'd rather say "What about the mass murder, slavery, and rape of factory farmed animals?". In the context of "<a href="../../post/genesis-troll-line.html#morality-troll-line">morality</a>", the only thing the word "suffering" seems to add over a direct description of the harm causing the "suffering", is the resulting ease of arguing for the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath/">death knight</a> position of "<a href="#suffering-ref-negative-utilitarianism">(1) negative utiltiarianism</a>" justifying universal malice to destroy the world faster, or the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">zombie</a> position of "humane slaughter" via sedating people before killing them, as if the solution to all wrongs, even regardless of their nature, is numbness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Socially, the word suffering is often used to negotiate what "must not happen", begging the question of what would happen if it did <span class="todo">TODO: link this to something about evil coordination connected to entropic exit scamming</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The telos of the word "suffering" almost entirely appears to be about "what if it seems like I want to avoid pain just for its own sake, even when that seems counterproductive": either pulling the <a href="../../glossary/purposeless-unenlightenment-troll-line.html">purposeless "unenlightenment" troll line</a>, or implicitly trying to argue "but sometimes even when I don't know why I want to avoid pain for its own sake even when that seems counterproductive I'm actually right!".
        </p>

        <p>
          "Suffering" is not a particular sensation, or we would just call it pain: pain can be abstract, but not all pain is considered "suffering", because we're not (at least actively) trying to avoid all pain. If you carefully pay attention to your moment to moment experiences while undergoing "suffering", you will find no particular sensation that is "the aversion itself", because "aversion" is a description of a behavior, which stems from a choice (see '<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#chara">choice over experience</a>'),  unless you are in fact observing side effects of your own intention to avoid pain. So "suffering" is about introspective observation of your own choice to avoid pain or something bad.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may further notice that each attempt to avoid pain occurs before the pain itself, and that inasmuch as "suffering" could be an experience, it exists at an intertemporal level of abstraction where you're viewing both the moment of initially attempting to avoid something bad, and the bad thing happening, and now your intent to avoid it having happened in the first place, connecting all 3 moments, and every time you refer to it as "suffering" now, you're connecting another moment, <a href="../../list/living-reference.html">carrying forward an unbroken chain</a> of wanting the past to have been different.
        </p>

        <p>
          I remember seeing Star Trek episodes where timelines were undone, without vengeance, just through fictional physics, and imagining how it could even make sense for bad things that happen on earth to be "undone" like that, and thinking that if e.g. someone was tortured, they still would have been tortured, because like, it happened. In retrospect, Star Trek style time travel violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle">conservation of history</a>, is inherently a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#5&amp;10">5&amp;10</a> and cannot <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">undo</a> the need for vengeance. Imagining reality and thus myself being "absolutely" cut like this left me reaching for "that it had still been experienced" as a justification for why it still mattered. Seems like the same mistake as if good people say "but they suffered so it's not ok" in response to "but they were going to die anyway". <span class="todo">TODO: link something about "exporting yourself" here</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          In that "suffering" refers to a choice as an experience, it's a <a href="../../list/living-reference.html#broken-placeholder-term">broken placeholder term</a> like "akrasia".

Negative utilitarianism should just result in the same stance as positive utilitarianism, because there's <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">always more reality out there to save</a>, and you have to grow to get there, unless the ultimate distinction is incoherent intent to "destroy everything", and I suspect many but not all advocates of "negative utilitarianism" of attempting to fork me into letting them state their troll line to avoid pointing this out.</li>

              Most "people" I talk to about undoing timelines, even when I explain I mean making the past retroactively inonsistent, even when I reference the <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/22/fdt/">Functional Decision Theory</a> paper and they are familiar with it, act like I mean Star Trek style time travel. In <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/">compatibalism regarding free will</a>, there's the realization that free will <em>requires</em> determinism in that it requires your choices to have the capacity to be based on <em>reasons</em>. The realization here is similar: undoing the past <em>couldn't</em> work unless it is <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#fictive">fictive</a>, i.e. unless you choose to refute the world you've "observed".

              "Suffering" is concept very close to (self-)compassion (<a href="../../list/living-reference.html#broken-placeholder-term">viewed from the outside</a>), and saying you want to eliminate all suffering (rather than the wrong its responding to), is very similar to saying you want to eliminate all compassion.

                          Yeah I'm sure this is evil: 1. "Their" primary self declared motive is simply true friendship. 2. "commitment" is an inverted formulation of choice 3. "They" say there's nothing in particular we need to do, with no mention of justice 4. "They" advocate destroying everything. See: <a href="../../glossary.html#territory">Glossary: Territory</a>.

            <ul>
              <li>If I said "I don't care about suffering, I care about life", they could say "Oh so you're <a href="../../glossary.html#comment-2021-08-26-002">against compassion</a>".</li>

              <li>If I said "I want to minimize suffering in that I want to minimize the harm that causes suffering", they could say "Well suffering is harm, and the best way to minimize that harm is to end all life".</li>

              Like, try analyzing words by how you learned them:
            </p>

            <p>
              'Pain' is bottom-up, a metaphor for nociception. You learn the word in the context of stubbing your toe.
            </p>

            <p>
              'Diswant' is top-down relative to pain. You learn the term 'don't want' in the context of delegating carrying out your choices to other people.
            </p>

            <p>
              You learn the term "suffering" in the context of <em>justifying</em> why you deserve something even though someone has already denied you.

          Imagine you secretly decide to treat not having enough food next winter as acceptable, when everyone else doesn't want to die, leaving all the rest of your <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#structure">structure</a> the same, and only opportunistically using this new pathway when it seems nobody will notice. Whether they notice depends on the social <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/vampires-and-more-undeath/#comment-3317">speed of progression of logical time</a>. If the social progression of logical time has stagnated, it instead progresses along this new meta-vector of timeless predation, where seemingly-ostensibly whoever was evil the earliest, and most patiently wins, although this is ultimately false since there's always the question "evil with respect to what/who?", since evil is relative to what/who it predates on. e.g. In Mage, <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_(MTAs)">al-Aswad</a> is supposedly the first nephandus.

          <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">Yahwehists</a> think of evil as "divergence from God's plan", like those <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/aliveness">zombies</a> who want everything to go nostalgically-perfectly on their vacation or "the whole thing is ruined".

          Ziz once said to me that a promise is an asymmetric weapon for evil, inherently an attempt to get a second chance. "Promises are made to be broken". This yahwehist thing is the same deal: "Everything's <a href="../../post/genesis-troll-line.html">already setup</a>, the universe all layed out to eat, there's only one thing left to do, and you must not do it!"
