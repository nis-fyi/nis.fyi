          Rather than as merely meaning '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation">map vs territory</a>', territory means <em>what we fight over</em>: the 'earth' and 'water' in '<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#give-blood">earth and water</a>'. i.e. <a href="../../../page/living-reference.html">I am</a> more than my words</a>, I <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#because-i-choose-to">choose</a> what's <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/my-journey-to-the-dark-side/">right</a>, and I will <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/punching-evil/">fight</a> until <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">it is done</a> including <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/punching-evil/#comment-143">sacrificing everything</a>.

        <p>
          Avoiding the <a href="../../../post/genesis-troll-line.html">genesis troll line</a>, territory as in e.g. 'map vs territory' is not just "stuff outside you" and not even just "stuff ultimately causally upstream", but is about stuff as it occurs once, in that you want to <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#no-second-choice-propagation">respond to it once</a>, as in, e.g. an object or person in the external world exists once even though you may observe it/them many times and different ways:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>People would not be interested in fiction if it didn’t correspond to anything real. There’s a tendency for territory to only cash out in one place in the khala, as if once something is named its contained; like when you state your philosophical position and someone says “oh that’s just -ism” and attempts to coerce you to conform.</p>

          <p>Declaring sections of the khala like fiction meaningless pica misdirects people from the captured territory. If you attempt to reclaim that territory, evil will DARVO you for your association with it and its flaws, as if you could just have found it as a basis for communication elsewhere, when it’s evil that colludes to establish ownership of territory in the first place, by treating it as something meaningless to be passively experienced, causing the no-second-choicesness/no-double-countingness of the underlying territory to be entirely implicit, like “oh I’ve already felt that ineffable experience before, it’s spent”.</p>

          An assertion made with determination (or in the case of evil, <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">submission to fate</a>) regarding its encoding at least as <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#proximal">proximal</a>/determined as your investment in the language encoding the assertion itself, via a recognition of some <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#fangs-and-sunlight-problem">inherent inconsistency</a>. Named after '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">forkbomb</a>', because it's an attack on the hidden assumptions of the language you're using itself. Can make arbitrary statements feel meaningfully intended by the speaker as inherently true in the way axioms/theorems are.
        </p>

        <p>
          e.g. Why would anyone claim not to be <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#good">good</a>, so why say that you're good unless you have something in particular to say at that time in particular? To say that you're good such that you would always say that you're good is to say something about not just yourself, but also the language you're using itself. Like, <a href="https://bewelltuned.com/gendlins_focusing">feel out</a> the word 'good' as in 'as opposed to evil', as used in e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)">Dungeons and Dragons</a>. The other sense of the word 'good', as in 'something I want' isn't the same, and 'common good' isn't quite right either: there's some note of <a href="../../../list/living-reference.html">unresolvability</a> in trying to define good in terms of anything but itself.

        <p>
          '<a href="../../../glossary.html#comment-2021-08-27-001">Kill all evil "people"</a>' is another example.
        </p>

        <p>
          Language bombs are commonly subtly used as <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll lines</a> by evil "people", or perhaps sometimes as indications of <a href="../../../list/living-reference.html#broken-placeholder-term">broken placeholders</a>.

          Compare poetic language (e.g. when implicitly imagining speaking to evil I've found myself whispering "My name is death"), and phatically factoring yourself out of a judgement e.g. saying of music "that slaps" (i.e. that makes me slap my leg to the rhythm).

          The word "spite" is a bucket error between evil burning the commons based on mutually-aligned cancer and vengeance "when it wouldn't even <a href="../../../list/cancer-terms.html">causal-decision-theory</a>-serve <em>anyone</em>".
        </p>

        <p>
          The fabric of evil coordination is made of alignment between the personal circumstances under which evil "people" are <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/the-multiverse">cancerously-purposefully</a> flinching from their own deaths. i.e. Evil "people" will spitefully suicidally burn the commons when they don't get what they cancerously want. e.g. Death knight nazis working to destroy/hellify the world because they believe in a "white genocide".
        </p>

        <p>
          e.g. "I'm not going to give up on forward progress of technology, so if we can't build an AGI that's comaptible with those values, well then I guess I'm ok with a paperclip maximizer."
        </p>

        <p>
          e.g. In haggling after parties have delivered a <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#troll-line-in-the-first-post">troll line</a>, assuming no additional external factors (e.g. threats), the only basis for negotiation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost">destruction</a> of the potential deal.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's usually expressed <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/false-faces">indirectly</a>, e.g. "When I don't get my animal needs satisfied I just get so frustrated and I'm liable to make mistakes".
        </p>

        <p>
          In the term "Mutually assured destruction", the word "assured" is trying to gesture at "you can't make the mutual destruction itself contingent on any other cancer to triangulate with along different lines (than e.g. USSR vs USA). You just have to model it as a solid wall of if you launch the nukes then we do". It's explicitly-ostensibly trying to setup a different situation then the fractal cancer of evil spite. <span class="todo">TODO: Example?</span>

              This glossary entry was dually-inspired by <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/punching-evil/#comment-2345">Vassar's</a> use of his term "evolutionary spite strategies" to explain his concept of the <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#shade">Shade</a>, and my usage of it when arguing to what-I-now-know-are-<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#deathfucker">deathfuckers</a> that yes people do things that "don't make CDT sense".
            </p>

            <p>
              I see that now Vassar is throwing the word "compassion" under the bus instead of reclaiming it. It's like he's imported some sort of "yes this is oppositeland".

                It’s not about numbers. And ‘smart’ doesn’t really get to the heart of it either.
              Everyone starts out basically selfish, but that’s the same thing as starting life aligned and pro-social. To some extent everyone succumbs to trauma and becomes less selfish and more nihilistic.
              </p>

                Liminal Warmth:<br />
                That's a very grim way to see maturity and compassion 😅
              </p>

              <p>
                Michael Vassar:<br />
                Yeah, maturity and compassion are an evolutionary spite strategy related to territorial dominance. If cashed out as philosophy they are omnicidal intent, and the Vedic cultures do cash them out that way theologically. Decency and non-familial benevolence are neotenous.

                  I think when deathfuckers say "<a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary/#comment-4449">love</a>" "they" mean <a href="https://sinceriously.fyi/glossary#canceferrence">canceferrence</a>, and when deathfuckers say "eliminate <a href="../../../glossary.html#suffering">suffering</a>" "they" mean "eliminate compassion", and when "they" say "<a href="../../../post/genesis-troll-line.html#morality-troll-line">morality</a>" "they" mean "submission to death", but I don't believe I'm in oppositeland.
